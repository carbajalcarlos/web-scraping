                This week Germany finally gets its #GroKo, in plenary, transnational lists are a no-go, and Elon Musk‚Äôs magic spacecar is just loco!
German political leaders agreed on Wednesday to form a new coalition government.

MEP Manfred Weber said the agreement is a signal of stability for Germany and Europe.


The agreement in Berlin is a signal of stability for Germany and Europe. More upswing, migration limitation, better defence ‚Äì now it's time to get to work! #GroKo pic.twitter.com/mjemnBqz9u

But Julia Leonarda reckons the new government will be worse than the last‚Ä¶ and is looking for a new country to live in.


Looking for: new country to live in.
Sincere suggestions more than welcome.#GroKo #ThisNewGovernmentWillBeWorseThanTheLastAndIDidntThinkThisWasPossible #ImmaGoCryNow #Bye

Ned Richardson-Little noticed that not a single Minister in the new Grand Coalition cabinet comes from the East. ‚ÄúGreat work tackling that sense of regional alienation, guys.‚Äù

But the coalition treaty is very pro-Europe according to Jean-Claude Juncker. The word Europe appears 312 times.


.@JunckerEU on #GroKo: "I like the European chapter very much. It says Germany is ready to pay more into #EUbudget for more #EUAddedValue. I don‚Äòt know any other government that mentions the word #Europe 312 times in coalition treaty.‚Äú https://t.co/LAMTYskhgC

#GroKo is short for ‚Äúgrosse koalition.‚Äù But Berlaymonster said it sounds like a brand of weed-killer that very slowly kills off all known opposition. Try it now! New, but not necessarily improved.


#GroKo sounds like a brand of weedkiller.
"Buy Slow-acting GroKo! Kills off all known opposition, slowly! Now with a new but not necessarily improved recipe."

Speaking of German things that are slow to go, did you know the Berlin Wall has now been down longer than it was up? Twitter certainly did as pretty much everyone decided to tweet about it.
Including Milos Vojinovic‚Äè

Moving from Berlin to Strasbourg: it‚Äôs plenary week and the big focus was on transnational lists freeing MEPs from the chains of national boundaries to be selected or rejected by voters from across Europe.


üá™üá∫This week, the European Parliament is going to vote on a proposal to create a EU-wide constituency for European elections #EP2019üí°We have long advocated for this idea ‚Äì here are the main reasons for transnational lists: https://t.co/SvriMi4f9C #transnationallist #EPlenary pic.twitter.com/5LrJS2Rs6A
‚Äî JEF Europe (@JEF_Europe) February 5, 2018

So would they or wouldn‚Äôt they go for it? Spoiler alert! They didn‚Äôt.
The European People‚Äôs Party spearheaded the parliament‚Äôs vote against the initiative.


Good news for the democratic accountability of the @Europarl_EN. The #EPPGroup managed to defeat the #TransnationalLists for the next EP elections.
‚Äî EPP Group (@EPPGroup) February 7, 2018

But Zuzana Pavelkov√° said the EPP and GUE failed to do their homework.


If #Europe is a task, then @EPPGroup @ecrgroup and @GUENGL failed to do their homework today. #TransnationalLists
‚Äî Zuzana Plk (@ZuzanaPlk) February 7, 2018

Sam Ryan pointed out that last month Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he supported transnational lists, but this week his party voted against them.


‚ÄúI support a Europe-wide list for  the European Parliament. Let‚Äôs get people in cafes in Naples and restaurants in Galway talking about the same election choices‚Äù ‚Äì @campaignforleo speaking last month in Strasbourg

What did pass was a stronger #spitzenkandidaten process. From now on the president of the European Commission will be elected instead of selected.


And the @Europarl_EN also just supported @gonzalezpons' proposal to strengthen the Spitzenkandidaten process and make the appointment of the @EU_Commission president an election instead of selection. https://t.co/luGj0o2ozu
‚Äî Jimmy Bastings (@JBastings) February 7, 2018

MEP Danuta Huebner said the process is a matter of democracy and transparency.


No way back can be accepted by @Europarl_EN with regard to the democratisation of the procedure of electing the President of the European Commission. #Spitzenkandidaten process is for us a matter of democracy and transparency #EPlenary @EPInstitutional

Other highlights from plenary include a vote to ban geoblocking for online shopping.


No more blocking. No more re-routing. #EPlenary has agreed to end unjustified #geoblocking in the EU. It's a great news for online shoppers & sellers https://t.co/miJm51evzI #DigitalSingleMarket pic.twitter.com/GhpstOOUlR

But don‚Äôt get too excited ‚Äî pretty much all the cool stuff you want to buy online is excluded like online tv, Netflix, ebooks, online games, music downloads. So, yeah, 5 out of 10 for effort, but could try harder.


Already the press releases lauding the death of #geoblocking are flooding in. I call bullshit! Film, tv, sports, etc ‚Äì ie The Stuff I Actually Want To Buy ‚Äì are excluded. @EUparliament has only approved half a solution! pic.twitter.com/IaAJMOx4Ux

And on Thursday, MEPs voted on whether or not to bend space and time. In scenes not really reminiscent of Doctor Who, the parliament‚Äôs own Time Lords decided more study was needed on whether or not to scrap changing of clocks from winter to summertime.


Today MEPs are voting on whether to scrap the changing of the clock or not. We're pretty sure the EU (1) has better things to be doing (2) shouldn't be messing with time üëç pic.twitter.com/iCVyq8TX0O

Finally, staying with space travel, Elon Musk and SpaceX launched a Tesla Roadster into outer space on the world‚Äôs biggest rocket.

While everybody geeked out!
Euronews reported David Bowie‚Äôs Starman was the tune selection.

Stephen Fry liked the reference to The Hitchhiker‚Äôs Guide to the Galaxy on the car‚Äôs dashboard.

And Charles de Lauzirika‚Äè asked who would have guessed that HEAVY METAL would more accurately predict the future than 2001 or BLADE RUNNER?

And Nick Motown was willing to bet that even in the seemingly empty, vast expanses of space, the Tesla still somehow had an Audi driving 8cm behind it.
