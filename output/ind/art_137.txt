                This week, to Viktor Orban, Hungarian voters are allegiant, ongoing Brexit troubles  jeopardize the Good Friday Agreement, and in raiding Murdoch’s HQ, EU investigators are vehement.
 
On Sunday, Hungary’s populist prime minister Viktor Orban won a third term…

Nigel Farage said he is no longer “the EU’s biggest nightmare. Viktor Orban is going to be an even bigger nightmare because he doesn’t even intend to leave.”

Donald Tusk was not impressed. Could he be any chillier in his ‘congratulations” to Orban? asked Peter Foster.


Wow. Could @eucopresident Donald Tusk be any chillier in his 'congratulations' to Viktor Orban. #hungaryelections pic.twitter.com/yXvknJzTUv

All it’s missing is a huffy “I guess” added Berlaymonster.

The Council President was more forthcoming with his true feelings about Brexit. 
 
On Tuesday during a speech in Dublin, 


“This year I will be dealing with disintegration, not integration. Always with Irish interests at the centre”

he called Brexit one of the saddest moments in 21st-century European history. “Sometimes I am even furious about it,” he said.

Martin Hoscik retorted he should be furious with himself… for not giving David Cameron “meaningful concessions & reforms.” 


Re @donaldtusk being "furious" about Brexit – He was there when Cameron asked the EU27 for meaningful concessions & reforms and got none. Unless he's furious with himself and his own side, the emotion is entirely misplaced.

But Tusk warned that “thousands of people are looking with concern and anxiety to the future of the peace process after Brexit.” reported Conor McMorrow.

The Irish Border‏, comedy account, says it is the elephant in the room.

And Andrew Adonis described as “nonsense” David Davis’s claim that Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is influenced by Sinn Fein. 


‘David Davis says Irish border problem complicated because Varadkar influenced by Sinn Fein.’ Not just irresponsible nonsense, but what about that shamelessly uncomplicated £1bn to the DUP?

Finally, the European Commission raided media offices in several countries for potentially fixing prices on sports broadcasting rights.

One of the raids was on Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox office in London.

Unsurprisingly, Fox News didn’t report a single thing about it. Maybe they didn’t want Donald Trump to know? 


EU commission raids Rupert Murdoch Fox (@FoxNews owner) office in London, Michael Cohen office was raid as well BUT @FoxNews has not reported a single segment on this issues (maybe 1), to they not want @realDonaldTrump to find out about it?

Murdoch was the second Trump ally in two days to have his office raided by investigators.

Some people, including Scott Stedman, were quick to point out that the raid had nothing to do with the investigation against Trump. 


There is no indication at this point that the raid is connected to Mueller's investigation at all.

Nor was it “revenge” for Murdoch tabloid The Sun’s support for Brexit, Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova told James Crisp.

Spoof account The Murdoch Times reckoned an EU investigation has to be one of Rupert’s worst nightmares ever. 


Not a lot of detail yet about the EU regulators raid on Murdoch's west London offices. But if they're really going to rip into the history of the Murdochs and sports rights and sports rights cabals, this has to be one of Rupert's worst nightmares. Ever.

The team of Have I Got News For You were not particularly sympathetic.
