                Bulgaria, the European Union’s poorest member state, on 1 January took over the bloc’s six-month rotating presidency. The country will undoubtedly be under pressure by Turkey and Russia to move forward their difficult relations with the 28-members bloc.
In the meantime, the ongoing migrant crisis, Brexit and the future EU long-term EU budget are among the top items on the EU agenda.
“Bulgaria will take charge of the EU presidency at a key moment for the union … May the motto ‘United We Stand Strong’ guide us,” EPP-affiliated Prime Minister Boyko Borissov wrote in a post on Facebook.
The motto of the Bulgarian Presidency will be the same as the national motto of Bulgaria “Unity makes strength”. The motto is engraved above the Bulgarian National Assembly’s official entrance.
“I am confident that we shall work with success on our priorities, on continuity,” added Borissov.

The presidency, which rotates between different EU member states, will give Bulgaria the opportunity to chair meetings and set agendas, as the bloc grapples with the record influx of migrants, management of its borders, rising populism and Britain’s EU divorce.
Taking over from Estonia, Bulgaria will have to manage a June deadline for EU leaders to agree an overhaul of the so-called Dublin Regulation, which states that the country of arrival is responsible to deal with asylum seekers.
The system currently puts too much pressure on frontline states such as Greece and Italy, but countries have been divided over how to replace it.
Normalised ties with Turkey
To solve the refugee crisis, Sofia is also expected to push for normalised ties with Turkey, with which Bulgaria shares a 260-kilometre border.
Relations have soured dramatically between the bloc and Turkey since the failed coup against president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in 2016.
Ankara is unhappy with the lack of interest for developing EU-Turkey relations during the upcoming Bulgarian Presidency of the Council of the EU, according to a publication by the daily Hurriyet, quoted by Mediapool.
The article, titled “Turkey was ignored”, hits at the failure of Borissov to put a EU-Turkey summit at the agenda of the Bulgarian Presidency, as well as at the weak texts in which Turkey is mentioned in the 42-page Bulgarian Presidency Programme.
The article also criticizes Borissov for having recently said that the “hypocrisy” in statements reconfirming that Turkey will become a EU member must stop.



Estonian Presidency passes Turkey decision to Bulgaria
Estonia, which holds the rotating presidency of the Council of the EU, made it clear that no decision would be made following Angela Merkel’s call to end Turkey’s membership talks this year, passing the responsibility to the next presidency – Turkey’s neighbour, Bulgaria.


Reportedly Ankara expected Borissov to obtain the agreement for holding such a summit during the last European Council on 15 December.
Fake news?
Russia is also interested in leveraging its influence in Bulgaria during the presidency.
The Russian agency ITAR-TASS quoted on 1 January Bulgaria’s Minister for the EU Presidency Lilyana Pavlova saying that Sofia would put on the EU agenda the issue of lifting the EU sanctions against Russia.
“Prime Minister Boyko Borisov and the Bulgarian government consider it necessary to include the issue of sanctions as one of the priorities in the agenda of the upcoming debate. This issue will be discussed in various formats in order to find the best solution and resolve the problem,” Pavlova said, as quoted by TASS.
Such a statement sounds surprising. As others EU members, Bulgaria is not happy about the EU sanctions against Russia, as it sees business opportunities elapsing to other non-EU countries, such as Serbia. Nevertheless, every six months when sanctions were renewed, Bulgaria didn’t use its veto right which could kill the EU policy.
As Bulgaria now holds the EU Presidency, on the occasion of the last EU summit, Borissov has made it clear that his country would follow the EU mainstream as far as sanctions are concerned. But rather surprisingly, he mentioned the names of some of the EU countries opposed to the Russia sanctions.



EU leaders agree to roll over Russia sanctions ‘after intense discussion’
EU leaders yesterday (14 December) agreed to extend tough economic sanctions against Russia over its meddling in Ukraine for six months, EU Council President Donald Tusk said.


On 2 January, Pavlova said she was surprised by the interpretation of ITAR-TASS to statements she had made to several media last November. She said the issue of sanctions was “closed” during the Estonian Presidency, since at the last summit in December EU leaders decided to roll-over the sanctions until 30 July 2018.
The episode could be seen as a foretaste of Moscow’s tactics with Bulgaria, a country treated by the Russian establishment as an unfaithful former wife.
No-confidence
In terms of internal politics, the opposition Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) is readying a no-confidence vote in Borissov’s government over corruption. Mathematically, the vote could not pass, even if the mainly ethnic Turkish Movement of Rights and Freedoms (DPS), also in opposition, would back the motion.



Borissov blames opposition for ‘untimely’ no-confidence vote
Bulgarian PM Boyko Borissov on Saturday (4 November) blamed the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) for asking for a no-confidence vote at a time when the country is preparing to take up the rotating Presidency of the Council of the EU. 


The Bulgarian President Rumen Radev, who was elected with the support of BSP, has also been critical of Borissov. In his New Year speech, Radev made no mention of the Bulgarian Presidency of the EU, but said that 2018 “will be a test for Bulgaria’s democracy”.
Radev and Borissov are deeply divided on their assessment of Bulgaria’s democracy. Borissov is generally happy with the status quo and obviously counts on the Presidency to better defuse criticism from political opponents or the press.



Bulgarian President: I may be a general, but I don’t like warlike rhetoric
In a wide-ranging interview, Bulgarian President Rumen Radev, whose country takes over the EU’s  rotating six-month Presidency in January, discussed European policies, the upcoming Bulgarian Presidency, and  his contradictions with Prime Minister Boyko Borissov.


Reportedly, Radev still nourishes hopes that the judiciary system could be reformed to be able to counter high-level corruption. Unlike Romania, where even a former Prime Minister was sent to jail, in Bulgaria not a single high level official has been sentenced for corruption.
Collision course
On 2 January, Radev vetoed legislation demanded by Brussels aimed at tackling rampant corruption, saying it fails to protect whistleblowers.
Parliament approved the new law in late December with a view to merging several existing agencies into a single body to fight corruption.   It also broadened the list of high-level officials whose income, property and conflict-of-interest declarations would be subject to checks by the new body.
Parliamentarians however ruled out the possibility of lodging anonymous complaints against politicians, while also offering no protection from prosecution to whistleblowers.
Radev, warning of the “risk for repressive action”, said the proviso went against the Council of Europe’s Civil Law Convention on Corruption protecting people who report graft.
Radev’s veto obliges parliament to re-examine the bill but lawmakers can also overrule his objections, forcing him to sign the law even if it remains unchanged.
Environmentalists take the streets 
Protests in Sofia took place in the recent days against the decision by the Borissov cabinet to open construction of tourist facilities in the Pirin national park. The developments are highlighting the mysterious ways the country works.
On 28 December, Borissov’s cabinet took a decision which runts counter its own efforts to calm down the country politically during its EU stint.

Borissov wants no trouble during the Bulgarian Presidency. But it was him who put into the cabinet agenda a vote to build a second ski lift in Bansko.  As it always happens, his proposal was accepted. The development took place following a meeting of the PM with the United Patriots, a nationalist force that has consistently advocated the Bansko development, in favour of the business community against the environmentalists.
The Bulgarian nationalists, a minority partner in the Borissov cabinet, have lately exchanged their traditional rhetoric against lobbying for the highest bidder from the business community.
Svetoslav Terziev, a commentator for Sega daily, wrote that not all Bulgarians are ready to protest, but they represent a powerful charge of anger that can explode on any occasion. “Any sudden movement can mean not only losing balance but also falling into the deep. That’s why Borissov’s is so afraid. And if he’s so afraid, it makes sense for the people to get organised”, Terziev writes.

                The Moldovan constitutional court temporarily suspended the powers of President Igor Dodon yesterday (2 January) following his refusal to approve the appointment of several pro-Europe ministers.
Dodon, a figurehead leader who backs closer ties with Russia, repeatedly refused at the end of December to appoint five ministers and two deputy ministers put forward by his pro-EU Prime Minister Pavel Filip.



Moldovan PM: The time of frozen conflicts has passed
The Prime Minister of Moldova Pavel Filip told EURACTIV.com in an exclusive interview that there are good prospects for finding a solution to the Transnistria conflict, one of the post-Soviet frozen conflicts which have caused enormous harm to the region’s populations.


However, the court said “the president has the right to refuse to approve the candidacy of a member of the government just one time” as it announced the “temporary suspension” of his powers.
The appointment of the seven ministers will be made on 5 January by the prime minister or the speaker of parliament Andrian Candu, the court said.
Dodon hit back in a Facebook post, calling the decision a “serious violation of judicial procedures”, accusing the constitutional court ofentering “the grey zone of democracy”.
“It is a dishonourable and regrettable fall from grace for a democratic
state,” he added, promising “not to give in”.
Moldova, a former Soviet republic, is divided between supporters of closer links to Moscow and those who want integration into the European Union, which includes members of the current government.
Dodon is on good terms with Russian President Vladimir Putin and was the only foreign leader who attended the annual Victory Day parade on Red Square on 9 May his year.

The Prime Minister of Moldova Pavel Filip has sent an angry letter to the country’s pro-Russian President Igor Dodon, qualifying as “reckless” his request for observer status to the Moscow-led Eurasian Union and for the signature of a Memorandum of Understanding with this organisation.


Since May, however, the two countries have seen tensions in their diplomatic ties. Moldova expelled five Russian diplomats without giving a reason and Russia responded with equivalent expulsions.

                Arguing for an alternative vision of European cooperation, political scientist Richard Youngs told EURACTIV that an EU rethink must include new voices and involve a fully participative process of consultation, in line with what French President Emmanuel Macron has proposed in recent months. In his new book, Youngs describes how that can be achieved.
Richard Youngs is a senior fellow at Carnegie Europe and a professor of international relations at the University of Warwick. He has authored eleven books. His latest is titled Europe Reset: New directions for the EU.
He spoke to EURACTIV’s editor-in-chief Daniela Vincenti.
With the EU facing a multifaceted set of ongoing challenges, you argue for a European reset in your new book. What kind of reset?
Europe is beginning to emerge from the various crises of the last decade, but I think something is still structurally missed with the basic model of integration, so I think we should look at ways of reviving that model.
Leaders themselves have called for new ideas, new thinking on the basic module of integration. I think the key challenge, as we come out of the crisis, is perhaps the pressure and the momentum behind this new thinking is disappointing a bit. So my book tries to correct that, arguing for very concrete ways in which the EU can be made more participative and more flexible.
What kind of concrete ways?
What I propose is a Compact for European Citizens, taking advantage of a lot of very interesting and significant new democratic innovations going on in different countries in the EU. Citizens are engaged in local politics in different ways, often outside the mainstream channels of representative democracy.
Something has been changing in European politics over the last four or five years. There is positive potential in this, which I think, at the moment remains not fully harnessed into the European debate.
So what I try to do in the book in a very concrete way is suggest that this local democratic momentum might be channeled upwards through national political processes and into European debates. Not to replace the formal institutions we have or the top-down direction of EU reform, but try to complement it and supplement it in a more mutually reinforcing way.
What kind of Compact?
There is a lot of thinking around at the moment on including citizens through methods of random selection in local assemblies to get them thinking about what kind of EU they would like in the future.
Citizens must have more ability to set the European agenda, rather than EU reforms being designed in a top-down way, with citizens being included almost as an afterthought and simply being asked whether or not they agree or disagree with a particular EU decision.
We have seen over the last two or three years the dangers, the problems that can occur when citizens are not involved on a regular basis in European politics and then they are presented with referenda, perhaps without having been fully apprised with all the decisions that they have been asked to take. So I think we need a more regular participative form in terms of European democracy.
You argue for a bottom-up approach to move away from elitism in the EU project. But bottom-up has been implemented since the referenda in France and the Netherlands, which killed the European constitution and has led to rising populism, hasn’t it? Could there be a positive populism? 
First of all, I am not arguing that we need a purely bottom-up approach to EU reform. For me, the challenge is to get a more participative democracy and form a representative democracy dovetailed much more systematically together.
I think the whole debate about populism is a very, very difficult one; the whole concept is a rather slippery one in terms of its basic definition. I know many people would react to my argument that if we involve citizens more today, then that may simply lead to the EU’s disintegration.
But what I try to do is not to idealise European citizens. I think the very fact that there are such sharp divisions between different parts of our population today means that we need these inclusive processes in which people can argue out their different points of view.
So, it is not really a matter of if there is a good populism versus a bad populism. But there is pressure for there to be much more accountable politics and I think if you try to take the EU forward without taking that into consideration, you actually risk stirring up more populism further down the line.



Reality catches up with Macron’s projects of European democracy
Citizen consultations, transnational lists: France is trying to carry out Macron’s project for Europe but ambition has been scaled down. EURACTIV France reports.


You say that the EU needs to be designed in a way to manage better difference and diversity. Isn’t that a way of criticising the EU for what it has done since the implementation of the Lisbon treaty? Have we failed to lead a union that is united in diversity? 
There are many opinions that suggest that the diversity of the EU has widened over recent years and the EU has struggled to manage that. I don’t say anything particularly new in pointing that out. Many European governments’ leaders themselves have made the same point.
There is no magic solution, but something tangible is needed to bring citizens more to the forefront in the process of European integration. What seems significant to me is that EU governments’ leaders have been calling for the EU to reconnect with citizens for more than 20 years but nothing really tangible ever seems to happen, because this isn’t the kind of issue that ever gets to the top of the agenda as they always have something more urgent to look at.
So, year after year, this basic aim of democratising the EU that everyone seems to agree on in principle, in practice, it doesn’t seem to move forward in a concrete way. What my book tries to do is to suggest a few ways in which we could give more concrete substance to this aim.
But there are two institutions in the EU that are supposed to carry the voice of the citizens in the EU decision-making process: the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions. At the moment they are just consultative bodies, do we need to reshape them and allow them to initiate legislation?
Yes, all those kind of bodies need to be revived in this kind of way, but they also need to be revived in terms of their links downwards to citizens, so that that increases their own legitimacy and credibility when they are negotiating with their governments and other EU institutions.
So for me it’s that link downwards between the formal institutions. And this very dynamic ray of local democratic politics we are seeing emerging at the moment seems rather underdeveloped.
Can these ideas of a compact be used in the framework of the better regulation process? 
I think all those steps are very positive steps; they are part of an overall package of political reform that is needed.  The one additional element that I am seeking to contribute with this book is to say that, although we need a better approach to regulations, it is more important that subsidiarity is advanced in a way that is less technocratic and a little bit more open and participative.
Subsidiarity itself should be a way of introducing more democratic flexibility in the EU and not simply a technical principle decided on behind closed doors.
How to you shape that flexibility? Are you thinking about two-speed or variable geometry EU?
Two questions: First, how do we take the process forward? What I am suggesting is that this Compact on European citizenship should be part of a formal process of EU reform, but I think if formal institutions would show themselves as so conservative or so unwilling to listen to people’s voices, which might be the case and which I recognise this in the book, then there is a case for citizens beginning to form their own initiatives outside the formal institutional processes. So, perhaps there is an alternative, more bottom-up route simply to rethinking and proposing more innovative ideas for the future. That’s one question.
Then on the flexibility, I think the two-speed module at the moment looks as if it will play a part in the EU’s future.
My book expresses some skepticism about the two-speed module, because it risks new dividing lines to the extent to which a two-speed model is probably going to have to be imposed on some member states against their will. Very few member states are going to voluntarily relegate themselves to a second tier. I don’t think it provides that much scope for really far-reaching flexibility without stirring up a lot of new antagonisms.
The model of flexibility we need has to be more innovative and a bit more radical than the traditional two-speed variable geometry models.
Can reform be done without opening the treaties?
I certainly think that a more political impulse can be introduced without necessarily having to wait indefinitely for treaty change. Other, more far-reaching suggestions would need to be part of a far-reaching package of formal treaty change. But again, I am not arguing against one or the other. There are many, very sensible judicious ideas on the table for progressing with deeper integration; I am simply making the point that without arguing against these proposals on the table, we do need to change the political process which we get to deepen European integration.
French President Macron has put a number of ideas on the table to bring citizens closer to the EU. Do you think any of them is worth exploring? The democratic conventions?
The proposal for the democratic conventions is the proposal that comes closest to what I am suggesting in my book. At the moment it is not certain exactly how those conventions will be organised or implemented, but there is clearly great potential.
My point is slightly different in proposing democratic participations as constant over the long term rather than being set up for a limited amount of time.
I think the question is that citizens need to be able to set the agenda rather than these conventions being run at the behest of governments on governments’ terms.
The really significant thing is that if, as all EU leaders argue, we need to listen to citizens more in the process of European integration, we need to listen to citizens before mapping out a process of EU reform.
At the moment things happen rather back to front, the governments, including Macron, make it known what kind of reforms they want. He has already laid out his EU reform agenda, and they say, well, now let’s listen to citizens. And that appears to me as a kind of afterthought: governments and EU institutions mapping out what they want and then almost using democracy as a way of seeking approval for those plans.
For me, democracy has to be understood the other way round. First of all, we need citizens to think through what kind of European solidarity they want in European cooperation. And then use those ideas to feed into the reform agenda rather than doing it back-to-front.
What can bring a new sense of EU identity?
Identity based on core liberal values of tolerance and inclusiveness, which is perhaps a lighter form of common identity than some of the visions in the past talking about uniform types of EU citizenship. Perhaps we need to relax our vision of common identity.



Macron to deliver vision for EU democracy in Athens
President Emmanuel Macron will this week unveil his vision for European reform in Athens. On the menu is the eurozone, transnational lists for 50 MEPs and democratic conventions, whose results are expected ahead of the next EU elections. EURACTIV France reports.

In his new book, Youngs describes how that can be achieved. Richard Youngs is a senior fellow at Carnegie Europe and a professor of international relations at the University of Warwick. He has authored eleven books. His latest is titled Europe Reset: New directions for the EU. He spoke to EURACTIV’s editor-in-chief Daniela Vincenti. With the EU facing a multifaceted set of ongoing challenges, you argue for a European reset in your new book. What kind of reset? Europe is beginning to emerge from the various crises of the last decade, but I think something is still structurally missed with the basic model of integration, so I think we should look at ways of reviving that model. Leaders themselves have called for new ideas, new thinking on the basic module of integration. I think the key challenge, as we come out of the crisis, is perhaps the pressure and the momentum behind this new thinking is disappointing a bit. So my book tries to correct that, arguing for very concrete ways in which the EU can be made more participative and more flexible. What kind of concrete ways? What I propose is a Compact for European Citizens, taking advantage of a lot of very interesting and significant new democratic innovations going on in different countries in the EU. Citizens are engaged in local politics in different ways, often outside the mainstream channels of representative democracy. Something has been changing in European politics over the last four or five years. There is positive potential in this, which I think, at the moment remains not fully harnessed into the European debate. So what I try to do in the book in a very concrete way is suggest that this local democratic momentum might be channeled upwards through national political processes and into European debates. Not to replace the formal institutions we have or the top-down direction of EU reform, but try to complement it and supplement it in a more mutually reinforcing way. What kind of Compact? There is a lot of thinking around at the moment on including citizens through methods of random selection in local assemblies to get them thinking about what kind of EU they would like in the future. Citizens must have more ability to set the European agenda, rather than EU reforms being designed in a top-down way, with citizens being included almost as an afterthought and simply being asked whether or not they agree or disagree with a particular EU decision. We have seen over the last two or three years the dangers, the problems that can occur when citizens are not involved on a regular basis in European politics and then they are presented with referenda, perhaps without having been fully apprised with all the decisions that they have been asked to take. So I think we need a more regular participative form in terms of European democracy. You argue for a bottom-up approach to move away from elitism in the EU project. But bottom-up has been implemented since the referenda in France and the Netherlands, which killed the European constitution and has led to rising populism, hasn’t it? Could there be a positive populism? First of all, I am not arguing that we need a purely bottom-up approach to EU reform. For me, the challenge is to get a more participative democracy and form a representative democracy dovetailed much more systematically together. I think the whole debate about populism is a very, very difficult one; the whole concept is a rather slippery one in terms of its basic definition. I know many people would react to my argument that if we involve citizens more today, then that may simply lead to the EU’s disintegration. But what I try to do is not to idealise European citizens. I think the very fact that there are such sharp divisions between different parts of our population today means that we need these inclusive processes in which people can argue out their different points of view. So, it is not really a matter of if there is a good populism versus a bad populism. But there is pressure for there to be much more accountable politics and I think if you try to take the EU forward without taking that into consideration, you actually risk stirring up more populism further down the line. Reality catches up with Macron’s projects of European democracy Citizen consultations, transnational lists: France is trying to carry out Macron’s project for Europe but ambition has been scaled down. EURACTIV France reports. You say that the EU needs to be designed in a way to manage better difference and diversity. Isn’t that a way of criticising the EU for what it has done since the implementation of the Lisbon treaty? Have we failed to lead a union that is united in diversity? There are many opinions that suggest that the diversity of the EU has widened over recent years and the EU has struggled to manage that. I don’t say anything particularly new in pointing that out. Many European governments’ leaders themselves have made the same point. There is no magic solution, but something tangible is needed to bring citizens more to the forefront in the process of European integration. What seems significant to me is that EU governments’ leaders have been calling for the EU to reconnect with citizens for more than 20 years but nothing really tangible ever seems to happen, because this isn’t the kind of issue that ever gets to the top of the agenda as they always have something more urgent to look at. So, year after year, this basic aim of democratising the EU that everyone seems to agree on in principle, in practice, it doesn’t seem to move forward in a concrete way. What my book tries to do is to suggest a few ways in which we could give more concrete substance to this aim. But there are two institutions in the EU that are supposed to carry the voice of the citizens in the EU decision-making process: the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions. At the moment they are just consultative bodies, do we need to reshape them and allow them to initiate legislation? Yes, all those kind of bodies need to be revived in this kind of way, but they also need to be revived in terms of their links downwards to citizens, so that that increases their own legitimacy and credibility when they are negotiating with their governments and other EU institutions. So for me it’s that link downwards between the formal institutions. And this very dynamic ray of local democratic politics we are seeing emerging at the moment seems rather underdeveloped. Can these ideas of a compact be used in the framework of the better regulation process? I think all those steps are very positive steps; they are part of an overall package of political reform that is needed. The one additional element that I am seeking to contribute with this book is to say that, although we need a better approach to regulations, it is more important that subsidiarity is advanced in a way that is less technocratic and a little bit more open and participative. Subsidiarity itself should be a way of introducing more democratic flexibility in the EU and not simply a technical principle decided on behind closed doors. How to you shape that flexibility? Are you thinking about two-speed or variable geometry EU? Two questions: First, how do we take the process forward? What I am suggesting is that this Compact on European citizenship should be part of a formal process of EU reform, but I think if formal institutions would show themselves as so conservative or so unwilling to listen to people’s voices, which might be the case and which I recognise this in the book, then there is a case for citizens beginning to form their own initiatives outside the formal institutional processes. So, perhaps there is an alternative, more bottom-up route simply to rethinking and proposing more innovative ideas for the future. That’s one question. Then on the flexibility, I think the two-speed module at the moment looks as if it will play a part in the EU’s future. My book expresses some skepticism about the two-speed module, because it risks new dividing lines to the extent to which a two-speed model is probably going to have to be imposed on some member states against their will. Very few member states are going to voluntarily relegate themselves to a second tier. I don’t think it provides that much scope for really far-reaching flexibility without stirring up a lot of new antagonisms. The model of flexibility we need has to be more innovative and a bit more radical than the traditional two-speed variable geometry models. Can reform be done without opening the treaties? I certainly think that a more political impulse can be introduced without necessarily having to wait indefinitely for treaty change. Other, more far-reaching suggestions would need to be part of a far-reaching package of formal treaty change. But again, I am not arguing against one or the other. There are many, very sensible judicious ideas on the table for progressing with deeper integration; I am simply making the point that without arguing against these proposals on the table, we do need to change the political process which we get to deepen European integration. French President Macron has put a number of ideas on the table to bring citizens closer to the EU. Do you think any of them is worth exploring? The democratic conventions? The proposal for the democratic conventions is the proposal that comes closest to what I am suggesting in my book. At the moment it is not certain exactly how those conventions will be organised or implemented, but there is clearly great potential. My point is slightly different in proposing democratic participations as constant over the long term rather than being set up for a limited amount of time. I think the question is that citizens need to be able to set the agenda rather than these conventions being run at the behest of governments on governments’ terms. The really significant thing is that if, as all EU leaders argue, we need to listen to citizens more in the process of European integration, we need to listen to citizens before mapping out a process of EU reform. At the moment things happen rather back to front, the governments, including Macron, make it known what kind of reforms they want. He has already laid out his EU reform agenda, and they say, well, now let’s listen to citizens. And that appears to me as a kind of afterthought: governments and EU institutions mapping out what they want and then almost using democracy as a way of seeking approval for those plans. For me, democracy has to be understood the other way round. First of all, we need citizens to think through what kind of European solidarity they want in European cooperation. And then use those ideas to feed into the reform agenda rather than doing it back-to-front. What can bring a new sense of EU identity? Identity based on core liberal values of tolerance and inclusiveness, which is perhaps a lighter form of common identity than some of the visions in the past talking about uniform types of EU citizenship. Perhaps we need to relax our vision of common identity. Macron to deliver vision for EU democracy in Athens President Emmanuel Macron will this week unveil his vision for European reform in Athens.

                Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair today (4 January) warned voters that time was running out to reverse Brexit, a folly he said would torpedo Britain’s remaining clout and be regretted for generations to come.
More than a year and a half since the 2016 Brexit vote, the United Kingdom remains deeply divided over the planned EU exit that Prime Minister Theresa May says will take place on 29 March 2019.
Both opponents and supporters of Brexit agree that the divorce is Britain’s most significant geopolitical move since World War Two, though they cast vastly different futures for the $2.5 trillion UK economy and its relation with the world’s biggest trading bloc.
Blair, Labour prime minister from 1997 to 2007, said Britain would be poorer, weaker and warned that May had solved none of the problems over Northern Ireland’s post-Brexit status.



Blair announces return to British politics to fight Brexit
Former British prime minister Tony Blair said yesterday (1 May) he is taking the plunge back into domestic politics in order to fight Brexit.


“We are making an error the contemporary world cannot understand and the generations of the future will not forgive,” Blair said in an article published on his website today.
“2018 will be the last chance to secure a say on whether the new relationship proposed with Europe is better than the existing one,” Blair, 64, said.
Leaving the European Union was once far-fetched: just over 15 years ago, British leaders such as Blair were arguing about when to join the euro, and talk of an EU exit was the reserve of sceptics on the fringes of both major parties.
But the turmoil of the euro zone crisis, fears in Britain about immigration and a series of miscalculations by former Prime Minister David Cameron prompted the United Kingdom to vote 52 to 48% for Brexit in a June 2016 referendum.
Blair has repeatedly called for reversing Brexit, echoing other opponents of Brexit such as French President Emmanuel Macron and billionaire investor George Soros, who have suggested that Britain could still change its mind.
So far, opinion polls show little sign of a change of heart and it is unclear how Brexit could be stopped if both major political parties officially support the divorce.
Half of Britons support a second vote on whether to leave the European Union and a majority think the government may be paying too much money to the EU to open the way to trade talks, according to an opinion poll published last month.



Half of Britons support a second vote on Brexit, poll finds
Half of Britons support a second vote on whether to leave the European Union and a majority think the government may be paying too much money to the EU to open the way to trade talks, according to a new opinion poll.


Supporters of Brexit dismissed Blair and said he was undermining both the British negotiation and the will of the people.
“Blair and his elitist gang are damaging our negotiating strength, thus damaging our national interest by their continuing efforts to undermine democracy,” said Richard Tice, who helped found one of the two Leave campaign groups.
“History will not forgive them,” Tice told Reuters.
Blair is unpopular in Britain for his decision to back then-US President George W. Bush’s 2003 invasion of Iraq and the justification he used for going into a war that cost the deaths of 150,000 Iraqi civilians and 179 British soldiers.
But he has become increasingly outspoken about Brexit.
He implored his Labour Party, which is now led by socialist Jeremy Corbyn, to join the fight to stop Brexit.
“Make Brexit the Tory Brexit. Make them own it 100 percent,” Blair said. “If Labour continues to go along with Brexit and insists on leaving the Single Market, the handmaiden of Brexit will have been the timidity of Labour.”
Labour grassroots want second referendum
Eight out of 10 grassroots members of Britain’s opposition Labour Party want a referendum on the terms of the country’s exit from the European Union, according to a survey published today.
That is at odds with Corbyn’s official policy which calls for parliament, not the public, to have the final say on the terms of the deal.
It indicates a strong desire among the party’s rank and file members for a chance to demand a rethink on Brexit, or even overturn the outcome of the June 2016 vote to leave the EU.
The poll of more than 4,000 members of political parties was conducted shortly after last June’s national election as part of a three-year academic project by the Mile End Institute at Queen Mary University of London to discover more about people who belong to political parties.
It showed even higher demand for a second vote on Brexit among members of the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party. By contrast, only 14% of Conservative Party members wanted a referendum on the exit deal.
Mogherini: EU will ‘survive’ Brexit
The European Union will “survive” Britain’s Brexit departure and will remain strong, the bloc’s foreign policy chief said on Wednesday.
“Many believed that the referendum in the United Kingdom (on leaving the EU) was going to be the beginning of the end of the European Union,” Federica Mogherini said during a two-day visit to Cuba.
“I’m very positive on the fact that the Union is not only going to survive, but it’s going to go deeper,” Mogherini said.
“The world needs the European Unions to stay strong, and so, this is what are we are going to do,” she said.

                French President Emmanuel Macron announced on Wednesday (3 January) that a law against fake news is in the making in France. The legislation is clearly aimed at Russian propaganda and should be completed by the end of 2018, government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux added on Thursday.
“The current hype behind fake news is linked to the fascination for illiberal powers, and it is most of the time financed by the same powers,” Macron said.
He emphasised that certain websites are the mouthpieces for this kind of propaganda, but said that they have links to millions of fake social media accounts that are able to disseminate lies in every language within a few minutes.
“The democracy process is altered by this propaganda: the walls built between historical media and fake news are not working, as we have all seen during all presidential campaigns in our contemporary democracies,” Macron added, making a clear reference to the “information war” that Russia has been accused of driving.



Russian official: Information war part of ‘battle for the consciousness of the masses’
The new propaganda and cyber-warfare division of Russia’s ministry of defence is staffed by 1,000 people and has a budget of €300 million. Special efforts are being made to target the French presidential election. Euractiv France reports.


France wants to force online platforms to comply with transparency measures by identifying who pays for sponsored content, and by limiting the amount of money used to finance that content. Judges could also be summoned to deal with fake news during elections under the new law. Currently, judges can be consulted to rule on fake news but rarely are under the 1881 press freedom law.
Macron’s announcement that he will clamp down on fake news through new legislation could steal the European Commission’s thunder shortly before it reveals its own plans from Brussels.
EU Digital Commissioner Mariya Gabriel said after she took office last July that she will make tackling fake news a hallmark of her term. Macron’s plans to legislate will now put pressure on Gabriel. But the French president may also have given the Commission licence to take a tougher approach to how websites deal with fake news.
Shortly after Gabriel took office, she vowed to publish a strategy paper on fake news in early 2018. Her office is also setting up a so-called expert group that will advise her on how to address misinformation on the internet.
But while Macron made it clear that he will draft hard law to force websites to reveal where advertising money comes from and put a cap on the amount of sponsored content, the Commission’s approach will not be binding. Instead, Gabriel is expected to publish a document that highlights how online platforms could address fake news that is shared by their users.
Gabriel told a Brussels conference in November that her strategy paper will cover different sectors, since fake news is spread through audiovisual, written, online and other media forms.
“This misinformation evolves continually as technology evolves,” Gabriel said at the time.
The Commissioner said she is also considering how fake news is financed as part of the initiative.
The Commission is collecting feedback for the fake news strategy until mid-February. Some questions in the public consultation ask if online platforms should inform users if a post was created by a robot instead of a human, or explain what algorithms platforms may use to determine why they display certain content.
Another question asks if online firms should “provide greater remuneration to media organisations that produce reliable information online”.
Macron is not the only EU leader who has stepped up regulatory action against fake news. In October, heads of state from 27 member states—only Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy did not attend the summit—signed off on a document calling for steps “to shore up the integrity of our free and democratic societies in the digital age”.
Politicians across Europe are increasingly moving to regulate what is shared on internet platforms.
Germany passed a controversial law last year that will slap social media firms with hefty fines running up to tens of millions of euros if they do not quickly remove illegal content, including hate speech. As a result of the new law, Facebook announced last year that it hired hundreds of new staff members in Germany to monitor users’ posts for illegal information and flag them to be removed.

                The European Commission welcomed the action taken by the government in Skopje to end a 25-year stalemate on a name dispute with Greece and now hopes to see “concrete results”, a spokesperson told EURACTIV.com on Thursday (4 January).
Maintaining good relations between neighbours, including a negotiated and mutually acceptable solution to the name issue, under the auspices of the UN, remains essential, the Commission official underscored.
“In this regard, we welcome the steps taken by the government to engage in discussions with their counterparts in Greece to strengthen good neighbourly relations and we hope this will translate into further concrete results,” the spokesperson added.
The left-wing governments in Athens and in Skopje are optimistic about the resolution of an issue that has prevented the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) from entering the EU as well as NATO.
“I am optimistic that we can effectively and responsibly handle an issue that the previous governments have bequeathed to us, and to the extent that there is a real desire from the other side to take steps […] but we still have to see them,” Greece’s Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said.
Along the same line, FYROM’s Prime Minister Zoran Zaev said in a press conference last week in Thessaloniki that a solution is feasible, and that a date could be set to begin accession negotiations with the EU.
The country’s internationally recognised name is the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), but Skopje would prefer to be called Macedonia, which is also the name of a northern Greek province.
In 2012, Bulgaria joined Greece in vetoing the opening of EU accession talks with FYROM, despite a positive recommendation by the European Commission.
Several attempts have been made over the last years to find a solution to the issue, but both governments have failed to reach a compromise so far. But this time, analysts claim that there is positive political momentum since two left-wing governments are in power that have abandoned hard-line positions of the past.
In an interview with EURACTIV in September 2013, Radmila Šekerinska, a FYROM socialist former deputy prime minister responsible for European affairs, and the current minister of defence, said that the then conservative Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski (Vmro-Dpmne-EPP) used the name issue stalemate as an excuse “for some of our domestic so-called reformers not to deliver on any of the necessary changes to society”.
Asked about the “perfect name” for her, Šekerinska replied, “When I was little I was complaining that I dislike my name, but then I realised that having a rare name actually helps. So time is an element. As a citizen of this country – and I was raised in it under the name of Macedonia – I really do not understand the Greek position. But international politics just like domestic politics must sometimes solve a problem which seems irrational.”
Greece also considers Skopje to be misappropriating its ancient history. The airport in Skopje, for example, was named after Alexander the Great, who Greece sees as a hero of its ancient history. Athens was also disturbed by Gruevski’s Skopje 2014 project, when his government spent hundreds of millions of euros to build monuments depicting historical figures from the region of Macedonia.
But Social Democrat (SDSM) Zaev recently expressed his intention to break from that path.
“I give up (the claim) of Macedonia being the sole heir to Alexander. The history belongs not only to us but also to Greece and many other countries,” he said in December.



New Macedonia PM signals willingness to tackle row with Greece
Macedonia’s new Prime Minister, Zoran Zaev, has signalled a possible shift in the country’s sour relations with neighbouring Greece, which have blocked Skopje’s efforts to join the European Union and NATO.


What analysts say
According to David L. Phillips, the director of the program on peace-building and rights at Columbia University’s Institute for the Study of Human Rights, a solution on the name dispute would be beneficial for many actors.
“Tsipras would garner prestige and respect as a strong leader,” he said in an op-ed published in Kathimerini newspaper.
“Resolving issues with Macedonia would strengthen Greece’s sovereignty at a time when Turkey is demanding to upgrade the Lausanne Treaty, which created the boundaries of modern Greece and making designs on Greek territory in Western Thrace,” he added.
Regarding FYROM, Philips noted that a solution would open the door to Euro-Atlantic institutions, which will consolidate their democracy, free-market reforms, and fight against corruption.
According to Phillips, who worked as a senior adviser to the State Department during the Clinton, Bush and Obama administrations, the US wants to deepen cooperation with both countries to stem the tide of radicalisation and extremism in the Western Balkans.
“Washington wants to expand its military presence in Greece and set up new bases in the country. Improved cooperation can also help manage the possibility of another refugee and migrant crisis,” he said, adding that the EU, while dealing with Brexit, needs to show it is still viable as a proponent of peace in south-eastern Europe and beyond.
Bickering Greek politicians
In the meantime, the issue has sparked intense discussion in Athens between the government and the right-wing opposition party New Democracy.
Greece pushes for a compound name before the word “Macedonia”, which will be used in relation to everyone (erga omnes).
Following a meeting with top government officials on Wednesday (3 January), Greek Foreign Affairs Minister Nikos Kotzias emphasised this position, which was underlined at the 2008 NATO Bucharest summit.



Greek FM visits Skopje to build trust for ‘substantial’ talks on name dispute
Greek Minister of Foreign Affairs Nikos Kotzias will meet on Thursday (31 August) with politicians in Skopje in order to build up further trust between the two countries. But it’s still “early” for a discussion about the name dispute, diplomatic sources told EURACTIV.com.


At that summit, the then right-wing Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis (New Democracy-EPP) blocked the country’s bid to join NATO under its provisional name of FYROM.
“We are in favor of an understanding with all the parties and political forces of the country, with every personality and every citizen who is interested and who wants solutions to the issues that have dealt with the country, in order to open up a better future, without problems of the past oppressing the policies of our country,” he said.
But New Democracy blames the government for not having a common position on the issue.
Particularly, Panos Kammenos, the leader of the center-right junior coalition partner Independent Greeks and former New Democracy member, implied that he would not accept any solution containing the Greek term “Macedonia”.
He added, though, that he fully trusted the foreign affairs minister to handle the matter.
On the other hand, the conservative opposition threatened with a motion of no confidence in the event of a non-common position between the government partners.
Dora Bakoyanni, a former minister of foreign affairs and the sister of New Democracy’s current leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis, stressed that unless there was a common position of the government majority, her party would not support the Greek proposal, even if it agrees with it.
However, the opposition later toned down its rhetoric and argued that the government should be more responsible.
The Independent Greeks said that New Democracy was trying to destabilise the government in order to hide its internal divisions on the issue. Kammenos noted that Bakoyanni undermined Karamanlis at the 2008 NATO summit in Romania.
            ","The European Commission welcomed the action taken by the government in Skopje to end a 25-year stalemate on a name dispute with Greece and now hopes to see “concrete results”, a spokesperson told EURACTIV.com on Thursday (4 January). Maintaining good relations between neighbours, including a negotiated and mutually acceptable solution to the name issue, under the auspices of the UN, remains essential, the Commission official underscored. “In this regard, we welcome the steps taken by the government to engage in discussions with their counterparts in Greece to strengthen good neighbourly relations and we hope this will translate into further concrete results,” the spokesperson added. The left-wing governments in Athens and in Skopje are optimistic about the resolution of an issue that has prevented the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) from entering the EU as well as NATO. “I am optimistic that we can effectively and responsibly handle an issue that the previous governments have bequeathed to us, and to the extent that there is a real desire from the other side to take steps […] but we still have to see them,” Greece’s Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said. Along the same line, FYROM’s Prime Minister Zoran Zaev said in a press conference last week in Thessaloniki that a solution is feasible, and that a date could be set to begin accession negotiations with the EU. The country’s internationally recognised name is the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), but Skopje would prefer to be called Macedonia, which is also the name of a northern Greek province. In 2012, Bulgaria joined Greece in vetoing the opening of EU accession talks with FYROM, despite a positive recommendation by the European Commission. Several attempts have been made over the last years to find a solution to the issue, but both governments have failed to reach a compromise so far. But this time, analysts claim that there is positive political momentum since two left-wing governments are in power that have abandoned hard-line positions of the past. In an interview with EURACTIV in September 2013, Radmila Šekerinska, a FYROM socialist former deputy prime minister responsible for European affairs, and the current minister of defence, said that the then conservative Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski (Vmro-Dpmne-EPP) used the name issue stalemate as an excuse “for some of our domestic so-called reformers not to deliver on any of the necessary changes to society”. Asked about the “perfect name” for her, Šekerinska replied, “When I was little I was complaining that I dislike my name, but then I realised that having a rare name actually helps. So time is an element. As a citizen of this country – and I was raised in it under the name of Macedonia – I really do not understand the Greek position. But international politics just like domestic politics must sometimes solve a problem which seems irrational.” Greece also considers Skopje to be misappropriating its ancient history. The airport in Skopje, for example, was named after Alexander the Great, who Greece sees as a hero of its ancient history. Athens was also disturbed by Gruevski’s Skopje 2014 project, when his government spent hundreds of millions of euros to build monuments depicting historical figures from the region of Macedonia. But Social Democrat (SDSM) Zaev recently expressed his intention to break from that path. “I give up (the claim) of Macedonia being the sole heir to Alexander. The history belongs not only to us but also to Greece and many other countries,” he said in December.

                Many Poles choose Germany for a better life, as in their home country they feel that freedom standards are returning to those under communism.
Ula Lachowicz, 34, left Poland in 2014 for Germany, attracted by a booming job market. But today, employment is no longer the reason keeping her from returning home, she said.
In the last two years, “we have lost the freedom of speech, the freedom of having one’s own opinion, or doing what we want with our sexuality or culture” in Poland, said the marketing graduate from outside the northeastern city of Gdansk.
Lachowicz is one of a growing number of young Poles who are turning their backs on their home country, which they say has become stiflingly conservative.
Numbering more than 783,000 in 2016, including 55,000 in Berlin, Poles now make up the second biggest foreign community in Germany, after the Turks.
The diaspora was long attracted to Europe’s biggest economy for the jobs and higher salaries it offers compared to Poland, which became a member of the EU in 2004.
But since the nationalist and conservative Law and Justice party (PiS) took power in 2015, some Poles say employment is no longer the only reason pushing them to Germany.



With freedom of thought under fire, Poland drifts away from democracy
When I think about the past two years in Poland, the infamous poem by Władysław Broniewski – “Word about Stalin”, written on the occasion of the Soviet dictator’s 70th birthday – comes to my mind, writes Bartosz T. Wieliński.


Rather, these young and pro-European Poles say they have left their native land in search of a more liberal climate.
No official data is available on how many they number, but there are now regular forums by young Poles on the issue.
The Polish embassy in Berlin noted that Polish emigration “has been going on for years and statistics show no dramatic increase in the number of Polish emigrants since the ruling PiS party won the 2015 parliamentary elections.”
It added that surveys show that most Poles who leave are motivated by financial reasons.
“It is difficult to determine whether their decisions are also politically motivated or not,” said the embassy.
‘With us or against us’ 
Aleksandra Zebrowska, who arrived in Berlin in early 2017, argued however that Polish society “is less and less open, definitely more nationalist and more centred on Catholicism.”
The 26-year-old had moved from Warsaw to Berlin partly for work and its proximity to Poland, but she said that above all, she picked Germany because there she feels “simply free”.
Zebrowska, who works in the music sector, is part of a young generation of Poles who have benefited from the EU project.
The European Erasmus student exchange programme took her to Brussels for a year, while she also obtained a master’s degree in the Netherlands.
When she returned to Poland in 2015, a liberal government was still in charge.
But “after the elections, everything changed very quickly,” she said of the PiS which returned to power in October 2015 after eight years in opposition.
“Everyone looks at each other with suspicion… it’s exactly the feeling that my grandmother had during the communist era — you’re either with us or against us.”



Poland 'still' a democracy, says foreign minister
Poland’s foreign minister denied Wednesday (9 August) accusations that his EU country is drifting towards authoritarianism amid a string of government reforms that have triggered mass protests at home and EU warnings about rule of law violations.


‘Clearly changed’ 
The PiS’s arrival in power has been accompanied by increasingly fraught ties with Germany, including over Warsaw’s hardline stance against taking in asylum seekers during a record influx of refugees to the EU in 2015 and 2016.
Warsaw is also seeking to claim World War II reparations from Germany, even though Berlin insists that the issue had been settled decades ago.
On the European stage, Poland is posing a challenge to the authority of Brussels in enforcing democratic standards.
The European Commission launched unprecedented disciplinary proceedings against Poland late last month over its highly controversial judicial reforms which Brussels says threaten the rule of law.
“The situation.. clearly changed” in the last two years, said Maria Skora,33, who arrived in Berlin in 2015 from her native Wroclaw.
The project manager at a centre-left German think-tank said she found in Berlin the diversity that was lacking in Poland that she found to be “in an impasse.”
In a country which preaches a heterosexual and Catholic family structure, Filip Rutkowski, a 25-year-old gay artist, said he did not feel at ease.
“I didn’t fit the mould,” said Rutkowski, who has been living in Berlin since May last year.
In his new home city “we can express ourselves as we want, without being judged, without having to explain ourselves,” he said.
Journalist Ewa Wanat, 55, claimed that Poland is now ruled by a “soft dictatorship” as freedom of the press is greatly curtailed.
A former editor-in-chief at the public radio station RDC, Wanat said she was let go shortly before the PiS came to power for refusing to fire an employee who was seen as feminist and left-leaning.
For the laureate of the “Tolerantia” European prize against homophobia, a hardline push was already in the making and was a harbinger of the conservatives’ victory.
In 2016, she bought a one way ticket to Berlin. She can’t imagine returning to Poland now, saying that in Berlin, “the atmosphere is free.”

                Despite the well-known differences on trade, climate change and Iran, a closer examination of the EU-US strategy reveals a number of shared priorities for 2018, writes Fraser Cameron.
Fraser Cameron is Director of the EU-Asia Centre and a Senior Advisor at Cambre Associates.
Much of the European commentary following publication of President Trump’s national security strategy (NSS) in December was highly critical. But despite the well-known differences on trade, climate change and Iran a closer examination of the strategy reveals a number of shared priorities.
Trump announced that the US was engaged in a new era of competition facing rivals such as Russia and China ‘that seek to challenge American influence, values, and wealth.’ This is similar to EU assessments that point to Moscow and Beijing’s aggressive foreign policy and attempts to undermine democracy. Trump went on to state that he hoped ‘to build a great partnership with those and other countries’ which again is what the EU is trying to do. The EU still describes its relations with Russia and China as strategic partnerships although this description realistically can no longer be applied to Russia as there is almost a complete rupture in relations following its annexation of Crimea and support for separatist forces in eastern Ukraine. And despite Trump’s reluctance to criticise Putin his administration has now agreed to provide defensive weapons to Ukraine, a move that Obama refused to make.
Another highlight of the NSS was trade policy based on ‘the principles of fairness and reciprocity.’ If you listen to the litany of EU complaints against China, calling for ‘a level playing field’ you can see the similarities with Trump’s approach. Both the EU and US are negotiating bilateral investment treaties with China and facing similar problems on market access. Brussels and Washington are also tightening their trade defence instruments vis-à-vis China.
Trump also called for greater attention to homeland security and confirmed his intention to build a wall on the border with Mexico. The EU may not go in for building walls but some of its member states have erected pretty daunting fences to deter migrants. The EU has also struck a Faustian deal with Turkey and Libya to reduce the flow of refugees to the EU.
Another priority for Trump was modernisation of the military. Again this has been a top theme for Federica Mogherini with the December European Council endorsing her proposals for closer defence cooperation (PESCO). She has boasted that ‘more has been achieved in the past ten months than the past decade’. She will soon discover, however, that securing agreement on paper is one thing, securing agreement to rationalise defence procurement let alone place troops in harm’s way is quite another.
Although he emphasised the need for a strong economy, Trump also recognised the need to strengthen alliances to cope with new threats. Yes, these allies should pay more for their own security but there was no talk of the US going it alone in today’s world. Trump’s call for Europeans to pay more is also not new. It was a running theme of the Obama administration with his defence secretary, Bob Gates, starkly warning Europe that Americans were fed up with paying the lion’s share to defend Europe. The fact that his warnings were largely ignored by most EU governments has led Trump to up the rhetoric but it is not a change in American policy. Chancellor Merkel seemed to get it when she said last October that Europeans will have to look after their own security. But Berlin has been a laggard in moving towards the 2% NATO target for defence spending.
Trump is often and rightly criticised for not mentioning human rights as a foreign policy commitment. But he did say that while the US did not seek to impose its way of life on anyone it would champion American values without apology. He tends to use ‘freedom’ rather than human rights or democracy in his speeches but this is also a shared value with Europe.
The actual NSS document thus offers a certain continuity in US foreign policy although for domestic reasons Trump sought to distance himself from the ‘misguided views’ of his predecessors. They had been responsible for negotiating ‘disastrous trade deals’ at the expense of American jobs. They had failed to build up the nation at home, failed to fund the military, and failed to insist that America’s allies pay their fair share for defence. They had neglected the North Korean nuclear menace, made a ‘disastrous, weak, and incomprehensibly bad deal with Iran’ and had surrendered US sovereignty to ‘foreign bureaucrats in faraway and distant capitals.’
But all this was changing said Trump. He defended his decision to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the ‘very expensive and unfair’ Paris Climate Accord. He said that he had scolded the NATO allies who were not paying their fair dues. He promised that North Korea ‘will be taken care of’ without offering any details.
A sensible EU approach would be to seize the opportunities in the NSS to enhance cooperation with the US especially in dealing with Russia and China. The EU should also continue to reach out to different constituencies in the US to support EU objectives – Congress on the Iran deal, the individual states such as California on the Paris climate agreement. And above all the EU needs to have a serious discussion, post Brexit, about how to take more responsibility for its own security. Trump may have done the EU a favour by kick-starting this debate.

                It is usual for companies to hire hackers who identify weak spots which can bring down an organisation. By the same token, the European Union should give the Polish government a generous award for showing what makes the Union vulnerable, write Jan Jakub Chromiec and Adam Traczyk.
Jan Jakub Chromiec is a researcher at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin. Adam Traczyk is a co-founder and director of the Global.Lab think tank in Warsaw.
The weak spot of the Union is not just the right balance between more or less integration. Instead, its future will depend on public support for European values. To understand this claim, consider what would happen if Poland’s current political style became the gold standard across the Union.
At the very least, when member states  dismantle judicial independence,  limit media freedom and stifle non-governmental organisations, the Union loses credibility to conduct value-based foreign policy. A Union of member states dismantling democracy cannot credibly persuade neighbours to strengthen it.
Moreover, when countries stop respecting rulings of the European Court of Justice, as Poland recently did, common policies become worthless since they are no longer independently enforceable.
And when it comes to decision-making, imagine the outcome of European Councils where Kaczyńskiesque governments hold a majority. Incantations of “Germany first”, “France first” and other “firsts”, disregard for rule of law, and backtracking on commitments would wreck the European project.



Brussels triggers unprecedented action against Poland
European Commission Vice-President Frans Timmermans announced with a 04:13am tweet that the EU executive had activated Article 7 of the Lisbon Treaty against Poland, due to “a risk of serious breach of of the rule of law”.


In sum, when member states don’t respect European values – pluralistic democracy, rule of law, human rights – the Union as a rules-based system of peaceful conflict resolution among democracies risks breaking down. We can only speculate what kind of animal the EU would become instead, but we know from history that the alternative to rule of law is the rule of strength.
That’s why the Polish government should get an award.
On one hand, its conduct is a warning shot about the fragility of liberal-democratic institutions. These institutions are no more than pieces of paper converted into political power by public support. Take away this support and you will hold in your hands only pieces of paper.
On the other hand, identifying a weak spot means that solutions can be discussed. In this vein, we propose a two-fold approach of promoting European values: through a corrective and a preventive arm.
The corrective arm already exists, in the form of Article 7 of the EU Treaty which suspends the voting rights of a member breaching European values and a rule of law framework introducing dialogue before such a penalty is triggered. The flaw of these mechanisms is that they assume member states are persuadable by dialogue. When a country chooses confrontation over dialogue these mechanisms fail. Moreover, Article 7 is a ‘nuclear option’: once triggered, there are no further means of persuasion.
For this reason, some suggest punishing Poland by limiting its access to EU funds. This would be a double-edged sword. While it would probably reduce the government’s popularity, it would surely hurt the Polish people, for whom EU-friendly sentiment is fuelled in part by structural and agricultural funds from the EU budget.
Since correcting violations of European values is so difficult, the Union should invest more in preventing them from happening in the first place. Here is how this could be done.
In Poland, civil society in the form of watchdogs, campaign groups, independent media and think tanks is currently the most important promoter of European values. In July, non-governmental organisations carried out protests in roughly 250 cities, forcing the president to veto parts of a controversial judicial reform.
However, running such organisations is as hard as it gets. The government has slashed funding for critical NGOs, launched a National Centre for the Development of Civil Society in order to centralise public subsidies, and conducted  anti-NGO campaigns in the media. At a time where civil society is needed the most, its ability to operate is limited.
The Union already supports value-promoting NGOs in its neighbourhood. A European Instrument for the Promotion of Democracy and Human Rights, for instance, foresees €1.3bn for this purpose. But since democratic institutions are endangered within the EU, we need an instrument directed at member states.
This instrument, let’s call it ‘Fund for European Values’, would support NGOs promoting the values enshrined in Article 2 of the EU Treaty: rule of law, human rights and democracy. Funding, at a level similar to the EU’s spending on promoting values in third countries, would be available to organisations in all member states, to underscore that fostering values is important across the Union.
Setting up this kind of preventive arm would have three advantages.
First, it would balance the harsh language of sanctions with a positive message from Brussels. Secondly, it would contribute to limiting divisions in the EU by signalling that value-promotion is a task for all member states. Finally, and most importantly, it would contribute to strengthening the immune system of European democracies. Ultimately, democracy can only be upheld by people striving and fighting for it. As Friedrich Ebert, the first democratically elected president of Germany put it, democracy needs democrats.
The alternative is the prospect that some years from now, the institutions currently securing our freedom and prosperity might be reduced to worthless pieces of paper.
            ","It is usual for companies to hire hackers who identify weak spots which can bring down an organisation. By the same token, the European Union should give the Polish government a generous award for showing what makes the Union vulnerable, write Jan Jakub Chromiec and Adam Traczyk. Jan Jakub Chromiec is a researcher at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin. Adam Traczyk is a co-founder and director of the Global.Lab think tank in Warsaw. The weak spot of the Union is not just the right balance between more or less integration. Instead, its future will depend on public support for European values. To understand this claim, consider what would happen if Poland’s current political style became the gold standard across the Union. At the very least, when member states dismantle judicial independence, limit media freedom and stifle non-governmental organisations, the Union loses credibility to conduct value-based foreign policy. A Union of member states dismantling democracy cannot credibly persuade neighbours to strengthen it. Moreover, when countries stop respecting rulings of the European Court of Justice, as Poland recently did, common policies become worthless since they are no longer independently enforceable. And when it comes to decision-making, imagine the outcome of European Councils where Kaczyńskiesque governments hold a majority. Incantations of “Germany first”, “France first” and other “firsts”, disregard for rule of law, and backtracking on commitments would wreck the European project.

                Czechs will vote in a divisive presidential election starting Friday (12 January), seen as a test for the country increasingly split between the anti-Muslim, pro-Russian views of incumbent Miloš Zeman and more liberal currents.
The 73-year-old former communist Zeman is hoping to beat eight other contenders to clinch a second five-year term after his 2013 win in the EU member’s first-ever direct presidential vote.



Crimea cannot be returned to Ukraine, Czech president says
Ukraine cannot get back the Crimea peninsula, although Russia took it by annexation, Czech President Milos Zeman was quoted as saying on Friday (9 September).


But although polls show him in pole position, the outspoken head of state is unlikely to win an outright majority and may face a run-off round in two weeks.



Czech president 'very happy' with Trump win, says shares his views
Czech President Miloš Zeman declared on Wednesday (9 November) he was “very happy” with Donald Trump’s election victory, saying the Republican cut through political correctness and addressed key issues like migration.


Jiří Drahoš, his most likely opponent in the duel, could not be more different. A liberal centrist, the 68-year-old former head of the Czech Academy of Sciences is staunchly pro-European and has called for Prague to “play a more active role in the EU”.
Zeman echoes other populist-minded eastern EU leaders — especially in Hungary and Poland — at odds with Brussels over mandatory refugee quotas and various rules they see as attempts by Brussels to limit national sovereignty.
He also has harsh anti-Muslim views, having once called the 2015 migrant crisis “an organised invasion” of Europe and insisted Muslims were “impossible to integrate”.



Czech president attends anti-Islam rally on Velvet Revolution anniversary 
Milos Zeman, the President of the Czech Republic, attended a rally against refugees and Islam in Prague on Tuesday (17 November) on the anniversary of the 1989 Velvet Revolution, which peacefully toppled Communism in then Czechoslovakia.


Paradoxically, the country of 10.6 million people has received only 12 migrants under the EU quota system.
“The vote shows a broader conflict, it shows how society is polarised,” independent political analyst Jiří Pehe told AFP.
“It is a clash between… the post-communist part of society represented by Zeman and the other part, say, modern, pro-Western, which simply doesn’t want this president any more.”
A January survey commissioned by Czech Television showed Zeman losing a run-off to Drahoš, who beat him with 48.5% to 44%.

Liberal democracy under threat? 
No matter who wins, the next president will find himself battling a political crisis with roots in last year’s general election.
Analysts note that a Drahoš victory could upset government-building measures by the populist ANO movement of billionaire Andrej Babiš, a Zeman ally who won the October 2017 ballot.
ANO topped the vote, scoring 78 of 200 parliamentary seats campaigning on an anti-corruption and anti-euro ticket.
But the controversial tycoon, who is himself facing police charges over EU funding fraud, has found it impossible to form a majority government after being tapped prime minister by Zeman.
Babiš appeared set to lose a parliamentary confidence vote scheduled for 16 January.



Czech government set to lose confidence vote, but Babiš' party likely to retain power
Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš, battling allegations his business empire illegally tapped European Union subsidies a decade ago, looks certain to lose a parliamentary confidence vote on Wednesday.


Under the constitution, the president has another attempt and Zeman said he would tap Babiš again, should he fail to win confidence.
Pehe said Zeman’s victory might “pave the way for a deeper alliance with Andrej Babiš, which could lead to a change in some basic parameters of liberal democracy in the country”.
But the situation could change dramatically if Drahoš wins.
“Drahoš has made it very clear that a prosecuted man should not be prime minister,” Pehe said.
‘Poor health’ 
While Zeman vowed to unite society, his political views have done the opposite.
In China last year, Zeman told his ally Russian President Vladimir Putin that journalists should be “liquidated”.
He was also caught on camera verbally threatening to kill a cameraman at the Council of Europe headquarters in Strasbourg in October.
Zeman has stayed out of all election debates, saying he did not want to attack his rivals.
But Josef Mlejnek, a political analyst at Charles University in Prague, told AFP he believes that “poor health” was the chief reason, as the president suffers from diabetes-induced neuropathy.
Doctors have forced Zeman to curb smoking and drinking, but voters will recall him staggering during a ceremony at Prague Castle shortly after taking office.
And yet, his supporters remain faithful, lavishing praise on the man who beat aristocrat Karel Schwarzenberg in the 2013 run-off.
“If you want to save this country against Muslims, vote Zeman!” voter Marie Kubikova wrote on Facebook.
Zeman’s other rivals include ex-gambler and songwriter Michal Horacek, former rightwing premier Mirek Topolánek, and Vratislav Kulhánek, former head of Czech carmaker Škoda Auto.

                Nigel Farage’s apparent conversion in favour of a second referendum on Britain’s EU membership on Thursday (11 January) was manna from heaven gleefully received by British Remainers.
“Bring it on” was the reaction of the Best for Britain campaign, which opposes Brexit.
“For perhaps the first time in his life, Nigel Farage is making a valid point. In a democracy like ours, the British people have every right to keep an open mind about Brexit,” said Labour MP Chuka Umunna.
It might also have come to a surprise to many of Farage’s fellow Brexiteers.
“Not a prayer” was the verdict of a group of four Brexiteers led by former Trade Minister Digby Jones and Steven Woolfe MEP, who had earlier met with the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier, when asked whether there was a chance of Brexit being reversed.
But the excitement of a potential volte face by the former UKIP leader only lasted a few hours.
“To be clear, I do not want a second referendum, but I fear one may be forced upon the country by parliament,” Farage wrote in an article on the Daily Telegraph website on Friday.
That is not an outlandish prospect.
Brexit Secretary David Davis has already been forced to concede that MPs will get a ‘meaningful’ vote on whether to accept or reject the Article 50 exit terms, which could leave the door open for a second plebiscite.
In truth, the ‘hard Brexit’ faction, which believes that the UK should revert to trading with the EU on World Trade Organisation terms if it is not offered a generous free trade deal by the EU-27, remains in campaign mode.
It is also no secret that the ‘hard Brexit’ faction believes that Theresa May’s government played a poor hand in the first phase of negotiations with Barnier’s team.
They fear that the May government’s fragility is likely to lead to a protracted transition period after the Article 50 process formally ends in March 2019, leaving the UK as a de facto member of the bloc’s single market.
“The British people will not accept a deal that leaves them with all the hassles of EU membership without any benefits,” Jones told a small group of reporters in the European Parliament on Wednesday (10 January).
“A bad deal will not kill Euroscepticism in the UK, but would divide the Labour and Conservative parties,” John Mills, who ran the Labour Leave group, added.
“He (Barnier) wants it to happen,” added John Longworth, Co-Chairman of the Leave Means Leave campaign group.
Nor are Farage’s remarks that different to those of the four Brexiteers.
“What is for certain is that the Cleggs, the Blairs, the Adonises will never ever ever give up. They will go on whinging and whining and moaning all the way through this process,” said Farage on Thursday, almost identical language to that used by Jones, Woolfe and Longworth, who repeatedly referred to the “ABC cabal”.
The chances of a repeat referendum remain slim. May has ruled out another poll. Her Brexit minister Steve Baker commented that Farage’s remarks had provided “further confirmation of my long-held view that Nigel Farage is one of the greatest impediments to a successful Brexit”.
That did not stop bookmakers Coral and Betfair cutting their odds on another poll before the end of 2019 to 5-1.
And In the parlance of the bookies, 5-1 is significantly more favourable than just a prayer.

                Pro-Russian Czech incumbent Miloš Zeman clinched pole position in round one of a weekend presidential election, paving his way to a challenging run-off against pro-European Jiří Drahoš, full results showed on Saturday (13 January).
The face-off, on 26-27 January, is shaping up to be a clash not only of politics, but also personalities.
Zeman’s attitude to the European Union, of which the Czech Republic is a member, echoes populist-minded eastern EU leaders – especially in Hungary and Poland – at odds with Brussels over mandatory refugee quotas and various rules which they see as attempts to limit national sovereignty.
He is also stridently anti-Muslim, having once called the 2015 migrant crisis “an organised invasion” of Europe and insisted Muslims were “impossible to integrate”.



Czech president attends anti-Islam rally on Velvet Revolution anniversary 
Milos Zeman, the President of the Czech Republic, attended a rally against refugees and Islam in Prague on Tuesday (17 November) on the anniversary of the 1989 Velvet Revolution, which peacefully toppled Communism in then Czechoslovakia.


The EU and NATO country of 10.6 million people has received only 12 migrants under the EU quota system.
Zeman secured 38.56% of ballots from the election held on Friday and Saturday, while Drahoš garnered 26.60%, the Czech Statistical Office said.
“I invite all those who want to vote for me to come to the polling stations in round two too, and bring your friends, your lovers and their mistresses,” the flamboyant 73-year-old Zeman told supporters gathered at his campaign headquarters in Prague.
“In the previous presidential election (2013), I got 24% in the first round and 54% in round two, and this year already 40% in round one,” added the ex-communist who is also pro-China.
“I congratulate Jiri Drahoš for this beautiful second place.”

‘Huge problem’ 
Drahoš, 68, could not be more different. A mild-mannered liberal centrist whom critics have dubbed “wishy-washy”, he has called for Prague to “play a more active role in the EU” and has backed the adoption of the euro.
A former head of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Drahoš told supporters at his Prague headquarters that he would spend the next two weeks campaigning to “anchor the Czech Republic in Euro-Atlanticism” in a clear jibe at the Kremlin-oriented Zeman.
As the results rolled in, analyst Jiri Pehe told AFP that “Zeman will have a huge problem in the second round.”
“It is clear that the other candidates who have dropped out of the race, for example, Pavel Fischer, Marek Hilser and Michal Horacek, will vote Jiri Drahoš in round two,” Pehe said.
The combined voter support for the three also-rans stood at 28.24%.
Horacek and Hilser showed up at Drahoš’s headquarters to shake hands, while Fischer also voiced his support.
Horacek tweeted a picture of him hugging Drahoš and wished him “a lot of strength for the fight to come.”
A recent poll for Czech Television showed the divisive Zeman could flounder in round two with Drahoš poised to score 48.5% of votes predicted against 44% for the incumbent.
As he voted in Prague on Friday, Zeman was targeted by a bare-breasted anti-Kremlin protester who called him “Putin’s slut”, referring to Russia’s president.
Security personnel also had to help a visibly rattled Zeman, who walks with a cane, to leave the room.

A ‘polarised’ society 
After casting his ballot in Prague, Lubos Seidl said the election boiled down to “a clash between the people who think the old way and those who think the new way.”
Many voters remained undecided until the last minute, with Prague archivist Marcela Riegerova saying she “ended up tossing a coin to decide between two candidates, and Drahoš came out the winner.”
Analyst Pehe said the vote highlighted a “polarised” society.
“It is a clash between… the post-communist part of society represented by Zeman and the other part, say, modern, pro-Western, which simply doesn’t want this president anymore,” he told AFP.
Zeman has the backing of embattled billionaire Prime Minister Andrej Babiš, who said the incumbent “fights for our national interests” but called on him to “unite, not divide” Czechs.
Babiš’s populist ANO movement won last October’s general elections with its anti-corruption and anti-euro campaign, but the Slovak-born tycoon who is facing police charges over EU funding fraud has failed to woo coalition partners.



Czech government set to lose confidence vote, but Babiš' party likely to retain power
Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš, battling allegations his business empire illegally tapped European Union subsidies a decade ago, looks certain to lose a parliamentary confidence vote on Wednesday.


Tapped by Zeman for prime minister in December, Babiš was forced to form a minority government which appears set to lose a parliamentary confidence vote tomorrow (16 January).
Pehe said a victory for Zeman might “pave the way for a deeper alliance with Andrej Babiš, which could lead to a change in some basic parameters of liberal democracy in the country.”
But things could change dramatically if Drahoš wins.
“Drahoš has made it very clear that a prosecuted man should not be prime minister,” Pehe said.
The CTK news agency pegged turnout at 61.88% in the first round vote, similar to the last presidential ballot in 2013.

The face-off, on 26-27 January, is shaping up to be a clash not only of politics, but also personalities. Zeman’s attitude to the European Union, of which the Czech Republic is a member, echoes populist-minded eastern EU leaders – especially in Hungary and Poland – at odds with Brussels over mandatory refugee quotas and various rules which they see as attempts to limit national sovereignty. He is also stridently anti-Muslim, having once called the 2015 migrant crisis “an organised invasion” of Europe and insisted Muslims were “impossible to integrate”. Czech president attends anti-Islam rally on Velvet Revolution anniversary Milos Zeman, the President of the Czech Republic, attended a rally against refugees and Islam in Prague on Tuesday (17 November) on the anniversary of the 1989 Velvet Revolution, which peacefully toppled Communism in then Czechoslovakia. The EU and NATO country of 10.6 million people has received only 12 migrants under the EU quota system. Zeman secured 38.56% of ballots from the election held on Friday and Saturday, while Drahoš garnered 26.60%, the Czech Statistical Office said. “I invite all those who want to vote for me to come to the polling stations in round two too, and bring your friends, your lovers and their mistresses,” the flamboyant 73-year-old Zeman told supporters gathered at his campaign headquarters in Prague. “In the previous presidential election (2013), I got 24% in the first round and 54% in round two, and this year already 40% in round one,” added the ex-communist who is also pro-China. “I congratulate Jiri Drahoš for this beautiful second place.” The #Czech Republic’s pro-Russian president Milos Zeman will face a tough battle in the second round of the country’s presidential #election, after several defeated candidates threw their weight behind his pro-EU challengerhttps://t.co/ktaD2Pi6KG — Visegrad Insight (@VisegradInsight) January 15, 2018 ‘Huge problem’ Drahoš, 68, could not be more different. A mild-mannered liberal centrist whom critics have dubbed “wishy-washy”, he has called for Prague to “play a more active role in the EU” and has backed the adoption of the euro. A former head of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Drahoš told supporters at his Prague headquarters that he would spend the next two weeks campaigning to “anchor the Czech Republic in Euro-Atlanticism” in a clear jibe at the Kremlin-oriented Zeman. As the results rolled in, analyst Jiri Pehe told AFP that “Zeman will have a huge problem in the second round.” “It is clear that the other candidates who have dropped out of the race, for example, Pavel Fischer, Marek Hilser and Michal Horacek, will vote Jiri Drahoš in round two,” Pehe said. The combined voter support for the three also-rans stood at 28.24%. Horacek and Hilser showed up at Drahoš’s headquarters to shake hands, while Fischer also voiced his support. Horacek tweeted a picture of him hugging Drahoš and wished him “a lot of strength for the fight to come.” A recent poll for Czech Television showed the divisive Zeman could flounder in round two with Drahoš poised to score 48.5% of votes predicted against 44% for the incumbent. As he voted in Prague on Friday, Zeman was targeted by a bare-breasted anti-Kremlin protester who called him “Putin’s slut”, referring to Russia’s president. Security personnel also had to help a visibly rattled Zeman, who walks with a cane, to leave the room.

Zeman has the backing of embattled billionaire Prime Minister Andrej Babiš, who said the incumbent “fights for our national interests” but called on him to “unite, not divide” Czechs. Babiš’s populist ANO movement won last October’s general elections with its anti-corruption and anti-euro campaign, but the Slovak-born tycoon who is facing police charges over EU funding fraud has failed to woo coalition partners. Czech government set to lose confidence vote, but Babiš' party likely to retain power Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš, battling allegations his business empire illegally tapped European Union subsidies a decade ago, looks certain to lose a parliamentary confidence vote on Wednesday. Tapped by Zeman for prime minister in December, Babiš was forced to form a minority government which appears set to lose a parliamentary confidence vote tomorrow (16 January). Pehe said a victory for Zeman might “pave the way for a deeper alliance with Andrej Babiš, which could lead to a change in some basic parameters of liberal democracy in the country.” But things could change dramatically if Drahoš wins. “Drahoš has made it very clear that a prosecuted man should not be prime minister,” Pehe said. The CTK news agency pegged turnout at 61.88% in the first round vote, similar to the last presidential ballot in 2013.",12

                Warsaw banks on “dialogue” to solve its row with the EU over recent reforms denounced by Brussels as violating the rule of law, Poland’s new Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz said on Monday (15 January).
The European Commission last month launched unprecedented judiciary proceedings against the Polish changes, which Brussels says place courts under the control of the right-wing government and threaten democracy.
But Warsaw insists the reforms are needed to overhaul a system still haunted by the communist era.
“We will rely on dialogue for solving this issue,” Czaputowicz said in the Bulgarian capital Sofia during his first official visit abroad since being appointed last week.
“I would like to underline that we expect the intervention of the European Court (of Justice), which is the institution that, according to EU law, is responsible for such issues,” he added.
Czaputowicz’s trip to Bulgaria – the new holder of the bloc’s six-month rotating presidency – comes following a major government reshuffle seen as a clear signal that Warsaw wants to change the tone of its discussion with the EU.
Bulgaria, itself under EU monitoring for deficiencies in its judiciary and organised crime, is quite supportive of Poland in the row with the Commission.



Bulgaria sees little action against Poland any time soon
Member states may not reach a stage where they could take a vote on sanctions against Poland during Bulgaria’s six month EU presidency, Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov said on Thursday (11 January), explaining he would prefer to resolve the crisis through dialogue and avoid sanctions altogether.


Never before used against an EU member state, the so-called Article 7 proceedings can eventually lead to the “nuclear option” of the suspension of a country’s voting rights within the bloc.
This, however, is unlikely to happen as Poland’s ally Hungary has vowed to veto the measure.



The Brief – Kaczynski can relax, the EU won’t bite
If you want to know what is going on in the EU, speak to the Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov.


The EU gave Warsaw three months to remedy the situation, saying it could withdraw the measures if it did.
On 27 February, member states will hold their first ministerial meeting with Poland since the EU triggered the proceedings last month.
“Bulgaria as EU Council President will make every effort to continue the dialogue according to the plan that you mapped out – to present your stance and try to bring together the positions in order to find a solution to this really not very pleasant situation,” Bulgarian Foreign Minister Ekaterina Zaharieva said after talks with Czaputowicz.
Czaputowicz will travel to Germany later this week and has also asked for a meeting with EU vice-president Frans Timmermans.
Timmermans said on Monday he expected to “present the Commission’s case to the Council” during next month’s meeting.
“Poland will also present its case I suppose,” he told journalists in Brussels, with the Council then set to discuss the next step.

                A prominent Kosovo Serb leader was shot dead outside his party offices in Serb-run northern Kosovo on Tuesday (16 January), raising concerns of renewed tensions in the Western Balkans and prompting a Serbian delegation to cancel EU-sponsored talks with Kosovo in Brussels.
The killing of Oliver Ivanović is likely to stoke ethnic tensions in the former Serbian province that declared independence in 2008, just as the Serbia-Kosovo dialogue was set to resume as part of a new push to revive the region’s European perspective.
Unidentified perpetrators shot Ivanović, the leader of Srbija, demokratija, pravda (Serbia, democracy, justice) in Kosovska Mitrovica on Tuesday morning. He later died in hospital.
Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, who has made EU membership a top priority, called an emergency session of the national security council for later on Tuesday.
Marko Đurić, the head of Serbia’s Office for Kosovo, told Beta news agency before leaving Brussels that the attack on Ivanović was “an attempt to plunge the Serbs in Kosovo into chaos”.
“This is an attack on the entire Serbian people, to push them into the hell of a new conflict,” he said.
EU spokeswoman Maja Kocijančič also confirmed that “the dialogue discussions on a technical level were suspended”, without giving further details.
In 1998-99 Belgrade sent army and police troops to crack down on ethnic Albanians, who make up the majority of the population in Kosovo. The campaign was halted when NATO launched airstrikes against Serbia in 1999, after which the region was placed under UN supervision.
Relations between Serbia and Kosovo have been tense since Kosovo’s independence in 2008, which Serbia vowed never to recognise. But under EU pressure in 2013, both parties agreed to take part in EU-sponsored ‘dialogue’ on normalising relations, a key condition for both to progress towards membership of the bloc.



EU tells Kosovo relations will suffer if it scraps war crimes court
The European Union warned Kosovo today (12 January) that its relations with the bloc will suffer if it scraps a war crimes court linked to its bloody independence struggle.


The talks were set to resume on Tuesday but their fate now looks uncertain.
“We are abandoning the technical dialogue and returning to the country because of the murder,” Đurić was quoted as saying by Serbia’s official news agency Tanjug.
Bulgaria has made the Western Balkans a key priority of its six-month EU presidency, with an EU-Western Balkans summit scheduled for 17 May in Sofia.



Juncker throws his weight behind Bulgaria's Western Balkan plan
Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said on Friday (12 January) he would personally talk to each of the six Western Balkan leaders to hear what they expect from the plans by Bulgaria’s EU presidency to revive their long-stalled EU membership prospects.


Bulgaria’s Prime Minister Boyko Borissov condemned the murder in a statement.
“I expect political elites and all citizens to be mature and restrained. The rule of law cannot be called into question and I believe that those guilty of this crime will bear responsibility. I am convinced that the dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina has no alternative and that such acts should not be allowed to hinder it,” he said.
Kosovo President Hashim Thaçi also deplored the murder in a separate statement and urged the police to bring the perpetrators to justice as soon as possible.

                2018 will be the most important year for the Brexit process. With just over a year to go until the UK formally leaves the EU, there is still all to play for, where pro-Europeans in the UK like Open Britain can take courage from recent political and economic events.
Thomas Cole is head of policy & research at the UK-based pro-European Organisation, Open Britain.
Over the past 18 months, since the EU referendum vote, some key domestic developments have taken place: primarily, the UK government has lost its majority in the House of Commons and new facts, which could not have been predicted prior to the referendum, have begun to emerge. On this second point, this has included, for example, slowing economic growth due to Brexit-related uncertainty, where the UK is now one of the EU’s slowest growing economies. There has also been a drop in applications from nationals of the remaining EU member states to work as nurses in the UK’s National Health Service, and the value of the UK’s currency, the Pound Sterling, has dropped on the international financial markets, where it currently trades at around €1.12. With the eurozone far and away the UK’s largest trading partner, this has made imports from the rest of the EU more expensive and has made foreign travel for UK citizens to other EU member states less enticing.
None of these “new facts” are points which anybody in the UK should be happy about. However, they do point to a worsening trajectory of the UK’s fortunes since the Brexit vote, despite claims by leading cheerleaders of the Vote Leave campaign during the referendum that Brexit would see the UK become a land of milk and honey.
The logical question from this for all pro-Europeans in the UK then becomes, what happens if the positive future promised by those advocating for Brexit does not become reality? How should we proceed? The answer is simple.
If the path chosen by the government is not one with which the British people are ultimately happy, then they have every right to stop and reconsider. In November last year, Open Britain hosted an event with Lord John Kerr, one of the authors of the Article 50, where he clearly underlined that the UK’s notification of its willingness to leave the European Union under Article 50 could be withdrawn at any time prior to March 2019. Furthermore, as we have heard from European leaders ranging from Emmanuel Macron to Donald Tusk to Guy Verhofstadt, if the UK were to change its mind, the door to staying in the EU would remain open. Keeping an open mind on this process is important, where the UK’s Brexit secretary himself once famously said that a democracy which cannot change its mind, ceases to be a democracy.
Indeed, as the Brexit negotiations have unfolded, irreconcilable contradictions in the UK Government’s negotiation stances have become ever clearer – wanting to leave the internal market and the customs union but maintaining a fluid border with the Republic of Ireland; wanting to roll over existing EU trade deals with third countries whilst being oblivious to the fact that there is no guarantee that third countries will agree to this; wanting to stay inside EU executive agencies such as the European Medicines Agency (now leaving London for Amsterdam) whilst being outside of the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.
As these contradictions become ever clearer, throughout 2018, the having-cake-and-eating-it approach taken by the British government will slowly come up against the hard reality of international Realpolitik. In the coming months, if, as is likely, promises by Brexit advocates in the 2016 referendum become less and less deliverable and the UK’s future becomes less and less certain, everybody in the United Kingdom should reserve the right to reconsider the approach which has been taken. In 2016 nobody in the UK voted to see themselves worse-off and, if the British people change their minds, then Brexit will indeed be reversible.
Crucially, it is this year, of all years, where Pro-Europeans in the UK should continue to make their voices heard – they have every cause for optimism.

                Greece and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) are moving closer to resolving their 25-year-old name dispute, which should pave the way for Skopje to join NATO this year and possibly remove a major obstacle for its EU integration.
Shuttle diplomacy has shifted into higher gear, with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg due in Skopje on Wednesday and Thursday (17-18 January), and Greek and FYROM delegations meeting in New York for another round of UN-mediated talks.
Ahead of Wednesday’s meeting in New York, United Nations mediator Matthew Nimetz said on Tuesday that his proposal to resolve the decades-old name dispute would include the term “Macedonia.”
Greece opposes the one-word name ‘Macedonia’ because its own northern province has the same name and insists on a compound name. Instead, it pushes for a compound name before the word “Macedonia”, which will be used in relation to everyone (erga omnes).
In an interview with Greek Ant1 TV channel, Nimetz said that there was no magic and that it was impossible to come up with something totally new after years of efforts.
“If there was something totally new, we would have found it in the last 25 years,” he underlined, adding that he would come up with a new proposal because it’s a new time. “In the present circumstances people will look at different solutions in a new way and this is what I am trying to do,” he added.
Relations between the two Balkan neighbours have thawed after Social Democrat Zoran Zaev came to power in Skopje and set about undoing the legacy of his nationalist predecessors.
Nimetz said that the name ‘Macedonia’ is already contained in the country’s current name FYROM.
“So the term Macedonia is in the name now in the UN and recognised by Greece with that name [FYROM]. So the name Macedonia is connected with this country and I think we can find a solution that could meet Greek requirements and also satisfy the people in the northern neighbour,” the UN official explained.



Greece, Macedonia hope for UN proposal this month in chronic name dispute
Greece said yesterday (11 January) it and Macedonia hoped for progress in talks with a UN mediator on 17 January towards settling a long-running dispute over the latter country’s name that has held up Skopje’s EU membership prospects.
Greek Foreign Minister …


At the NATO Bucharest summit in 2008, the then right-wing Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis (New Democracy-EPP) blocked Skopje’s bid to join NATO under its provisional name of FYROM. Its EU accession has also been on hold, in part due to the name dispute.
Greece’s Alternate Minister of Foreign Affairs Georgios Katrougalos said the negotiation was open and provided a window of opportunity but struck a note of caution.
“Under no circumstances should its result be taken for granted, and above all, there is no result at the moment. When there is progress, the House will obviously be informed as well as the Greek people,” he said, referring to the Greek parliament.
In another interview with the Greek public television on Monday (15 January), the UN negotiator highlighted the positive contribution of the confidence-building measures taken under Greece’s Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias, as well as the “very constructive” response of Skopje.
Skopje ‘cautiously optimistic’
FYROM’s Foreign Minister Nikola Dimitrov was also cautiously optimistic.
“I expect that on Wednesday (Nimitz) will put his ideas and proposals on the table – an initial frame to enable substantial progress and negotiations. After that, we will get involved more directly and we [the two foreign ministers] will head the negotiating teams from both countries,” Dimitrov  told BIRN but added:
“Despite all the optimism, we have to accept the possibility that we may not be able to overcome our differences at this time, but we are adamant about keeping at it until we do”.
Russians see US pressure
In Skopje, NATO Secretary General is expected to meet president George Ivanov, Foreign Minister Nikola Dimitrov and Defence Minister Radmila Sekerinska.
Analysts say he is expected to encourage Macedonia’s democratic progress and praise its efforts to resolve the name dispute ahead of the NATO summit in July.
In the meantime, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov issued a statement on Monday hinting that the US was pressing for a solution to the name dispute in order to speed up the country’s accession to NATO – a move that would deal a strategic blow to Russia’s ambition of reasserting its influence in the Balkans.
Lavrov said the issue had been dormant for a long time and is emerging again “when the US decided that Skopje should be in NATO”.
Speaking in the European Parliament today, Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, presented Bulgaria’s relations with Skopje as an example for the Western Balkans as a whole.
Bulgaria was the first country in the world to recognise Macedonia, and it recognised it under its constitutional name.
The parliament in Skopje ratified on Monday (15 January) a landmark bilateral treaty with Bulgaria, signed last August. The document is expected to settle the outstanding issues between the two Balkan countries. Borissov said the Bulgarian Parliament will ratify the treaty very soon.



Bulgaria pledges to champion Macedonia's EU and NATO dreams
The European Union has welcomed the signing of a bilateral treaty between Bulgaria and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, in which the EU member has promised to support the latter’s EU integration.

In an interview with Greek Ant1 TV channel, Nimetz said that there was no magic and that it was impossible to come up with something totally new after years of efforts. “If there was something totally new, we would have found it in the last 25 years,” he underlined, adding that he would come up with a new proposal because it’s a new time. “In the present circumstances people will look at different solutions in a new way and this is what I am trying to do,” he added. Relations between the two Balkan neighbours have thawed after Social Democrat Zoran Zaev came to power in Skopje and set about undoing the legacy of his nationalist predecessors. Nimetz said that the name ‘Macedonia’ is already contained in the country’s current name FYROM. “So the term Macedonia is in the name now in the UN and recognised by Greece with that name [FYROM]. So the name Macedonia is connected with this country and I think we can find a solution that could meet Greek requirements and also satisfy the people in the northern neighbour,” the UN official explained. Greece, Macedonia hope for UN proposal this month in chronic name dispute Greece said yesterday (11 January) it and Macedonia hoped for progress in talks with a UN mediator on 17 January towards settling a long-running dispute over the latter country’s name that has held up Skopje’s EU membership prospects. Greek Foreign Minister … At the NATO Bucharest summit in 2008, the then right-wing Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis (New Democracy-EPP) blocked Skopje’s bid to join NATO under its provisional name of FYROM. Its EU accession has also been on hold, in part due to the name dispute. Greece’s Alternate Minister of Foreign Affairs Georgios Katrougalos said the negotiation was open and provided a window of opportunity but struck a note of caution. “Under no circumstances should its result be taken for granted, and above all, there is no result at the moment. When there is progress, the House will obviously be informed as well as the Greek people,” he said, referring to the Greek parliament. In another interview with the Greek public television on Monday (15 January), the UN negotiator highlighted the positive contribution of the confidence-building measures taken under Greece’s Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias, as well as the “very constructive” response of Skopje. Skopje ‘cautiously optimistic’ FYROM’s Foreign Minister Nikola Dimitrov was also cautiously optimistic. “I expect that on Wednesday (Nimitz) will put his ideas and proposals on the table – an initial frame to enable substantial progress and negotiations. After that, we will get involved more directly and we [the two foreign ministers] will head the negotiating teams from both countries,” Dimitrov told BIRN but added: “Despite all the optimism, we have to accept the possibility that we may not be able to overcome our differences at this time, but we are adamant about keeping at it until we do”. Russians see US pressure In Skopje, NATO Secretary General is expected to meet president George Ivanov, Foreign Minister Nikola Dimitrov and Defence Minister Radmila Sekerinska. Analysts say he is expected to encourage Macedonia’s democratic progress and praise its efforts to resolve the name dispute ahead of the NATO summit in July. In the meantime, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov issued a statement on Monday hinting that the US was pressing for a solution to the name dispute in order to speed up the country’s accession to NATO – a move that would deal a strategic blow to Russia’s ambition of reasserting its influence in the Balkans. Lavrov said the issue had been dormant for a long time and is emerging again “when the US decided that Skopje should be in NATO”. Speaking in the European Parliament today, Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency, presented Bulgaria’s relations with Skopje as an example for the Western Balkans as a whole. Bulgaria was the first country in the world to recognise Macedonia, and it recognised it under its constitutional name. The parliament in Skopje ratified on Monday (15 January) a landmark bilateral treaty with Bulgaria, signed last August. The document is expected to settle the outstanding issues between the two Balkan countries. Borissov said the Bulgarian Parliament will ratify the treaty very soon. Bulgaria pledges to champion Macedonia's EU and NATO dreams The European Union has welcomed the signing of a bilateral treaty between Bulgaria and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, in which the EU member has promised to support the latter’s EU integration.",16

                The opposition VMRO-DPMNE of former Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski in Skopje, possibly encouraged by Russia, is trying to hinder the resolution of a name dispute with Greece that has blocked the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia’s (FYROM) progress in joining NATO and the European Union.
Crucial talks to solve the 26-year old name dispute took place on Wednesday (18 January) in New York under the auspices of the UN, led by  US diplomat Matthew Nimetz, who has been in charge of the difficult dossier since 1999.
All UN member states currently recognise FYROM as a sovereign state, but remain divided over what to call it, Macedonia (its official constitutional name, opposed by Greece) or FYROM.
The European Union officially calls it FYROM and whenever EU officials made the mistake to call it “Macedonia”, they had to find a way to apologise.



Iconoclast Mogherini calls Macedonia ‘Macedonia’
EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini surprised many in the press room today, when she called ‘Macedonia’ the country that calls itself Macedonia.


Greek newspaper Ethnos reported on Thursday that Nimetz proposals were in English and Slavic and all of them included the term Macedonia.
The newspaper quoted anonymous sources as saying that the proposed names were “Nova Macedonia”, “Upper Macedonia” and “Northern Macedonia”. The website www.MKD.mk listed five proposals:
Republika Nova Makedonija
Republika Severna Makedonija
Republika Gorna Makedonija
Republika Vardarska Makedonija
Republika Makedonija (Skopje)
None of these names on the list a really surprising and anyone with some knowledge of the issue could draw up a similar list.
But FYROM negotiator’s statement, issued after the trilateral talks, quickly overshadowed the positive momentum that existed before.
Following the talks between the representatives of the two countries in New York, FYROM Ambassador to the US Vasko Naumovski told Sitel TV channel that no one could impose a new name on his country.
“Our country has a name, which is ‘the Republic of Macedonia’, a name that forms the basis of our identity,” he noted.
He also claimed that the proposals put forward by Nimetz were far from “an honest solution”.
Only hours later, the government in Skopje sought to distance itself from Naumovski, issuing a differently worded statement.



Commission expects ‘concrete’ results on Macedonian name dispute
The European Commission welcomed the action taken by the government in Skopje to end a 25-year stalemate on a name dispute with Greece and now hopes to see “concrete results”, a spokesperson told EURACTIV.com on Thursday (4 January).


Doublespeak?
“The UN is creating the conditions for the process to move forward”. “The outcome will depend on the readiness of the two sides to compromise, taking into account the differences,” the government stated.
Asked if there are fears that the hardliners may prevail again on the issue, an EU spokesperson said only: “We welcome the steps taken by the government to engage in discussions with their counterparts in Greece to strengthen good neighbourly relations and we hope this will translate into further concrete results.”
“Maintaining good neighbourly relations, including a negotiated and mutually acceptable solution to the name issue, under the auspices of the UN, remains essential,” the EU official told EURACTIV.
A pro-VMRO-DPMNE President
Naumovski was appointed by the country’s current President Gjorge Ivanov, who is an ally of the previous government led by the nationalist centre-right VMRO-DPMNE, an affiliate of the European People’s Party (EPP).
As prime minister, Nikola Gruevski took a hard line on the name issue and for many years the negotiations were frozen.



EPP hails positive momentum on Macedonia name dispute
The centre-right European People’s Party (EPP) is satisfied with the new rapprochement between Skopje and Athens, as the two sides aim to unlock Macedonia’s NATO bid and open the door to EU accession talks. But some within the party counselled caution.


Pundits believe that Gruevski had no intention whatsoever to open the doors of his country for EU accession because such a scenario would limit his long-established capacity to milk the country for the profit of the VMRO-DPMNE elite.
In an interview with EURACTIV in September 2013, Radmila Šekerinska, a FYROM socialist former deputy prime minister responsible for European affairs, and the current minister of defence, said that the then Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski used the name issue stalemate as an excuse “for some of our domestic so-called reformers not to deliver on any of the necessary changes to society”.
A source present at the June 2017 pre-summit meeting of the EPP in Brussels, admitted that since Social Democrat Zoran Zaev took power, there was a “clear indication of a change of direction” that was worth exploring. Zaev has sometimes been called “The Macron of the Balkans”.



The Brief, powered by Eni – Meet the Macron of the Balkans
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, was in Brussels today (5 December) and gave the best talk show in town for many months, speaking at the Centre for European Policy Studies.


“It looks like the tough line adopted by Gruevski is falling apart”, he added. But he warned that decisive change will only come if Zaev manages to follow a different policy from Gruevski in the longer term.
It was also reported that Gruevski’s camp is trying to use the new prime minister’s “overtures” towards Greece and Bulgaria as ammunition with which to destabilise or even topple Zaev’s government.



Bulgaria pledges to champion Macedonia's EU and NATO dreams
The European Union has welcomed the signing of a bilateral treaty between Bulgaria and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, in which the EU member has promised to support the latter’s EU integration.


However, another source close to VMRO-DPMNE warned against “excessive enthusiasm”, recalling that Greece’s longstanding position was that the name dispute should be solved first before any other business could be addressed.
The official also said that the socialist government needed to understand that the national interest was more important than party politics.
“They show flexibility to impress their neighbours but in the long run they have to have public opinion on their side as well,” he told EURACTIV.
The internal divisions in Skopje politics were escalated this week when President Ivanov blocked a law making Albanian the country’s second official language.
Ethnic Albanians account for 25% of the total population of the country and the bill would allow them to use the Albanian language in their interactions with state institutions.
Ivanov stressed that legislation would introduce a “very expensive redundancy” in state institutions “instead of building a multiethnic society through a spirit of dialogue and coexistence”.
On 1 March 2017, Ivanov refused to allow a coalition of Social Democrats and parties representing the country’s big ethnic Albanian minority to form a government because of their pledge to allow a wider official use of the Albanian language. This prompted Council President Donald Tusk to act as a fireman to prevent bigger damage.



Tusk tells Macedonia, paralysed by political crisis, to focus on EU entry
European Council President Donald Tusk said in Macedonia yesterday (3 April) he hoped the country’s leaders would avoid fuelling ethnic tensions and focus on advancing towards EU membership instead.


Russia opposes any action that could encourage Albania, a staunch US ally, from nourishing hopes of widening its influence in the region.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov issued a statement this week hinting that the US was pressing for a solution to the name dispute in order to speed up the country’s accession to NATO – a move that would deal a strategic blow to Russia’s ambition of reasserting its influence in the Balkans.
Lavrov said the issue had been dormant for a long time and is emerging again “when the US decided that Skopje should be in NATO”.
In an interview with EURACTIV in March 2017, Russia’s Ambassador to the EU, Vladimir Chizhov, made a reference to the 2001 Ohrid agreement between the Skopje government and ethnic Albanian representatives, which put an end to the conflict between the  Albanian ‘National Liberation Army’ and Macedonian security forces.
The agreement included provisions for altering the official languages of the country, with any language spoken by more than 20% of the population becoming co-official with the Macedonian language on a municipal level.
“The Ohrid agreement was brokered by nobody else but my good old friend Javier Solana, and I pointed out to him then the possible dangers of that agreement, which fixed a quota for Albanian representation. Actually, I asked him if he would follow this example in the Baltics, but didn’t get much of an answer,” Chizhov said.



Russia: Commission should play a more positive role in the Western Balkans
Speaking to EURACTIV.com, Russia’s Ambassador to the EU, Vladimir Chizhov, criticised the European Commission’s handling of the crises in Macedonia and Kosovo, and regretted the “hysteria” over alleged Russian interference in Montenegro.


NATO accession 
In the meantime, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has been in Skopje since Wednesday (17 January), where he is meeting politicians from the government and the opposition.
In an interview with the Macedonian Information Agency (MIA), Stoltenberg made clear that Skopje would not join the alliance unless the name dispute with Greece is resolved.
“No. NATO’s position remains unchanged. All decisions in NATO are reached based on a consensus among all NATO allies,” he said.
At the NATO Bucharest summit in 2008, Greece’s right-wing Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis (New Democracy-EPP) blocked Skopje’s bid to join NATO under its provisional name of FYROM.



NATO setback upsets Macedonia's EU hopes
The failure of Macedonia to secure an invitation to join NATO at the Alliance’s summit despite the accession of its neighbours could have a negative impact on its bid to join the EU, according to a number of politicians and analysts. EURACTIV Romania contributed to this report from Bucharest.


Athens insists on a compound name before the word “Macedonia”, which will be used in relation to everyone (erga omnes).
The next NATO Summit will be held in Brussels in July.
Zaev’s government hopes to solve the name issue and open the door to NATO accession, but also for a decision to start EU accession talks in June.
The Commission issued a recommendation to start accession negotiations with Macedonia in December 2005. Without the Greek veto, Macedonia – at least in theory – could have long ago wrapped up the negotiations. Croatia, another ex-Yugoslav republic, started accession talks in 2005, completed them in 2011 and joined the EU on 1 July 2013.

                Czechs choose their new president next week (26-27 January) and the increasingly heated election campaign, pitting the incumbent pro-Russian Miloš Zeman against pro-European academic Jiří Drahoš, has focused on the issue of migration.
Although the president has little say in foreign policy and acts merely as a representative of the country abroad, migration has become a hot topic while media have been flooded with fake news and disinformation spread by supporters of the two candidates.
It escalated on Thursday when Zeman’s supporters published adverts and banners saying “Stop migration and Drahoš, this country is ours, vote for Zeman”.
Drahoš has never said he wants to open the country to the migrants, nor does he support relocation mechanisms proposed by Brussels, which have been strongly opposed by the Czech government since the beginning.
“Today it is clear that distribution of refugees among 28 countries doesn’t make any sense,” Drahoš, 68, said on his official website.
“Europe should provide temporary humanitarian aid to real refugees, if possible outside its external borders, close to their homes,” explained Drahoš, a former chairman of the Czech Academy of Science.
The two candidates’ positions on migration are not too far apart but Drahoš has come to be seen as a “refugee welcomer” whereas Zeman, 73, has become a symbol of “refugee refusers”.



Czech interior minister: 'Nobody has to call us for solidarity'
The Czech Republic has not relocated a refugee for more than a year and remains in breach of its legal obligations. The Czech position remains the same despite the ruling of the Court of Justice supporting the Commission’s migrant relocation policy. EURACTIV.cz reports.


Drahoš’s opponents also say that he had been a member of the State Security (StB), the secret police of the communist regime in power from 1945 until the Velvet revolution in 1989. To refute the allegations, Drahoš published a document that confirms he had no connection to StB.
But Zeman is also battling disinformation. Before the first election round, Czech voters found leaflets in their post boxes saying that Zeman will go through to the second round automatically and they don’t have to vote for him. The interior ministry had to publish an official statement to deny this.
Then there is speculation surrounding Zeman’s poor health. Some influencers have even claimed that his leg has been amputated and that he suffers from cancer. This was later denied by Zeman’s doctors.
The two will have a chance to battle it out in a television debate next week.
So far Zeman has refused the idea of such debates. But now seems more keen to take part in them than to attend to the country’s current political problems.
According to his spokesperson, Zeman could not find time this week for a meeting with Andrej Babiš (ANO), the winner of the parliamentary elections who lost a confidence vote in parliament on Tuesday.
It had been expected and previously confirmed by Zeman’s office that the president would accept the resignation of Babiš’s minority cabinet. But he suddenly rescheduled the meeting for next Wednesday (24 January), just two days before the second round of the presidential ballot.
In the meantime, Babiš is having another go at forming a government despite being short on allies and facing fraud charges.
On Thursday (18 January) he met with the far-right leader Tomio Okamura, who claimed afterwards that ANO’s programme is now closer to some of his Direct Democracy Party’s priorities and that talks about a possible cooperation would continue.
If Okamura’s party joins Babiš, they would have 100 MPs between them, but Babiš needs 101 votes to pass the next vote of confidence so he may try to convince some of the other parties to cooperate.
Some opposition MPs said they could support an ANO government but not with Babiš at the helm.
Babiš, his wife and grown-up children, as well as several co-workers, were charged before the election with fraud in winning a €2-million subsidy, mostly from European Union funds. However, he regained immunity from prosecution after being re-elected.
He has denied wrongdoing but later said that he doesn’t insist on being prime minister. “That’s something the ANO party has to decide.”

                Despite the soothing presence of Elton John and Cate Blanchett, love, peace and goodwill to all is unlikely to break out at the Davos World Economic Forum next week. Not when Donald Trump is in town.
“Creating a shared future in a fractured world,” is the suitably earnest theme of next week’s World Economic Forum, a staple in the calendar for the motley crew of CEOs, world leaders and a sprinkling of celebrities who gather in the small Swiss town of Davos.
It’s just as unlikely to be a happy week for the self-styled economic and political elite.

This time there will be no such niceties. Trump will address delegates on 25 January, and White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders has signalled that the US President will use his speech “to advance his America First agenda with world leaders.”
That agenda has so far involved scrapping the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and mothballing trade talks with the EU. That could mean a full frontal attack.
Europe will also be well represented. Jean-Claude Juncker, who the Commission concedes is “not a fan” of the Davos meetings, will speak for the first – and probably last – time as Commission President.
If the annual bunfight in Davos faces something of an existential crisis, at least its poster-boy will be in town and is likely to front an international fightback against the Trump doctrine. A Rothschilds banker turned centrist politician, Emmanuel Macron’s Davos credentials could hardly be more impeccable.
One as yet unanswered question is whether Angela Merkel will leave the interminable coalition talks in Berlin to take up the cause of free trade and liberal democracy alongside Macron. A final decision on Mutti’s attendance will take place following a CDU party meeting on Sunday, her spokesman Stefan Seibert told reporters.
If Theresa May’s presence will serve as an irritating reminder of Brexit’s unwanted presence on the EU agenda, trading rhetorical barbs with the US President should come as light relief to Macron, Merkel et al.
After years of navel-gazing about its own existential crises, European leaders will have the novelty of being able to discuss another institution’s problems.

                Tens of thousands of people took to the streets of northern Greece’s biggest city Thessaloniki on Sunday (21 January), police said, in a long-running row between Athens and Skopje over the use of the name Macedonia.
Athens argues that the name Macedonia suggests that Skopje has territorial claims to the northern Greek region of the same name, of which Thessaloniki is the capital.
The region was the centre of Alexander the Great’s ancient kingdom, a source of Greek pride.
Police said more than 90,000 demonstrators had joined the protest in Thessaloniki, organised by hardline clerics, far-right leaders and Greek diaspora groups.

Protest leaders said at least 400,000 people had turned up.
“We estimate there were at least 400,000 people. It is impressive,” rally organiser Anastasios Porgialidis told AFP.
Some minor scuffles erupted between the protesters and anarchists who had organised a counter-demonstration, prompting police to intervene with tear gas.
The rally drew members of the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party who had gathered around the statue of Alexander the Great along with local clergy.


Aaaaand here's the Golden Dawn party marching for Macedonia. They love Greece so much that once their leader said that their homeland is Germany and ""deutschland über alles in der welt"".

Representatives from the main opposition party, New Democracy, were also present despite a tacit order from its liberal-minded leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis to boycott the protests.
On Sunday after the rally, however, Mitsotakis hailed the “impressive turnout that proves the particularly great sensitivity of society to the issue”.
Cretans in traditional costumes who travelled from the southern island with their horses, as well as people from northern Greece wearing costumes from the Macedonian wars era a century ago, crowded at the White Tower on the Thessaloniki waterfront from early in the morning.
Police said 284 buses had transported people from around Greece to the port city.

‘Not negotiable’ 
Greece and Macedonia returned to the United Nations last week hoping to reach a compromise that could end the 27-year dispute over the former Yugoslav republic’s name.
Greece’s objections to the use of the name Macedonia since the Balkan country’s independence in 1991 have hampered the tiny nation’s bid to join the European Union and NATO.
“We want to warn our politicians not to dare to betray us. Macedonia is Greek and this is not negotiable”, said protester Dimitris Triantafillidis, 50, a shop owner from the northern regional district of Pieria.
The UN negotiator Matthew Nimetz — a 24-year veteran on the issue — said last week that he was “very hopeful” that a solution was within reach.



Tensions grow before biggest secret is revealed: FYROM's new name
The opposition VMRO-DPMNE of former Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski in Skopje, possibly encouraged by Russia, is trying to hinder the resolution of a name dispute with Greece that has blocked the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia’s (FYROM) progress in joining NATO and the European Union.


Despite the nationalist fervour that is also being fed by Golden Dawn, Greeks appear to be less militant on the issue than in the past.
In 1992, more than one million people — 10 percent of the population — joined a rally in Thessaloniki to proclaim that “Macedonia is Greek”.
According to a survey conducted for Greek radio station 24/7 by the Alco polling group, 63 percent of respondents said they thought it was in Greece’s best interests to seek a mutually acceptable solution at the UN talks.
And the Greek Orthodox Church, which is traditionally opposed to the use of the term Macedonia by Skopje and led the 1992 rally, appears to have distanced itself from Sunday’s events.
Its leader Archbishop Ieronymos on Thursday reportedly told Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras that “national unity is needed… (not) protests and shouts”.
‘National stupidity’ 
Tsipras, who is expected to meet with his Macedonian counterpart Zoran Zaev at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, next week, said in an interview published Sunday: “If there is an opportunity for a solution, it would be a national stupidity not to make good use of it.”
However, he told Ethnos newspaper that he could understand “the concerns and sensitivities” of the Greeks of the north.
Macedonia is known as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) at the United Nations, although the Security Council acknowledged this was a provisional name when it agreed to membership.
If a deal is reached at the UN talks, it will be put before Greek parliament for approval, with the government expecting the compromise name to be approved despite opposition within some parties.
According to Macedonian media, Nimetz has proposed five alternatives all containing the name.

                In an increasingly fractured world, change will not happen if the current model of corporate greed continues to dominate the future, 2018 World Economic Forum co-chair Sharan Burrow told EURACTIV in an exclusive interview.
Sharan Burrow is the General Secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), a former President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and one of the seven co-chairs of the 2018 World Economic Forum.
She spoke to EURACTIV editor-in-chief Daniela Vincenti, ahead of the opening of the 48th annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos on Monday (22 January).
As one of the seven co-chairs of this year’s World Economic Forum, what are your expectations for next week’s WEF, now that we know that President Donald Trump and President Emmanuel Macron are coming to Davos?
The challenges exist irrespective of the political heads of state. We are living in an increasingly fractured world: the authoritarianism even in democratic countries, the increase in dictatorship and the increase in militarisation are adding up to shrinking democratic space. And a world that is now looking at the possibility even of nuclear war. This is a framework for potential devastation.
When you add that to the global risks which already exist – an economic model that has failed working people, a wave of misogyny that has further excluded women from the mainstream of equality, the question of a dominant model of low wages, insecure and unsafe work, distrust and the retreat into nationalism led by some leaders like Donald Trump – that actually is rendering the global economy even more unstable.
Meanwhile, people are growing increasingly distrustful of all global institutions, whether it is global economy, multi-national, multilateral organizations, and their own government. We see a fractured world. It is not a base on which to build a future, unless we have people committed across government, business, civil society and unions to sit down and negotiate global solutions. And those global solutions have to be based on the sustainable development goals, which include jobs and decent work, fundamental human rights, equality for women and sustainability with the elimination of poverty.
Last year, leaders in Davos agreed to more redistribution of wealth in order to fight the growing inequality caused by globalisation. One of the other WEF co-chairs, Christine Lagarde, warned years ago about the impact of rising inequality but remained mostly unheard. As this seems to have changed now, do you see any tangible results since January 2017?
Public statements about risk have indeed been part of the analysis. But her institution has recommended austerity at every turn. They have attacked wage policies, they have attacked social protection. As recently as just a few months ago, the IMF’s advice to Iran was more of the same and people in Iran are now on the streets, because they do not trust governments, whether it is the current government or the reformists and they do not have the security of good jobs, of wages on which they can live with dignity, they are fighting for themselves and their children.
Lagarde’s statements, although accurate on climate, on inequality, on women, are not the whole picture. Her own institution is still demanding conscriptions of governments on an economic and social front which is actually a part of the problem.
It is not just the IMF, if you look across their multi-national institutions; you see the threat to the WTO and the very heart of international trade. We believe that the WTO has failed, because of the lack of political courage to actually deal with some of the issues like human rights, labour rights and environmental standards. Nevertheless, it is the institution that should be charged to do this and now it is in fact very vulnerable. When you look at the fracturing of political space at the national level, when you look at the vulnerability and, indeed, the lack of trust people now have in their multi-national institutions, we need to find negotiated solutions.



EIB, WEF tell EU to embed social inclusion in economic policy
At a time of rising inequality across Europe, the European Investment Bank and the World Economic Forum have jointly sounded the alarm bell and called for social inclusion to become an organic part of EU economic policy.


But do you have the feeling that everything is a bit repetitive? They come together, they decide something, then they go back home and change does not happen as the courage is not there to implement what has been agreed.
Change will not happen if the current model of corporate greed continues to dominate the future. The world became three times richer in the last three decades. And yet: When 84% of the worlds’ people cannot live on the minimum wage, when people are deeply anxious about employment and the security of employment, when you have major corporations – particularly American corporations – refusing to bargain with their workers to share productivity, then that level of greed is not just creating the one percent and vast inequality, it is putting the very economic model that these corporations have demanded in their own interests at risk.
We know you have to change the rules and in fact, polling shows that 85% of the world’s population says you have to change the rules. And if you read the Global Risk Report, released by the World Economic Forum, it shows that they are simply deepening the already fractured world we live in. They are not just risks anymore; many of them are now having a serious impact. We need to change, we need a different future or the model of a world where we can be confident around an integrated future, where everybody has confidence to actually be part of our economy and society.
For change, there needs to be leadership. With the election of Macron, we might have experienced this in a way, as he has completely uprooted the old political system and is trying to rebuild trust. Do you think there is a new type of leadership emerging?
Democracy has to have the confidence of the people. You have to ask the question, whether his leadership in Europe is respected. If we do not have robust democracy, if we are not able to contest ideas, then ultimately democracy fails.
And while I am confident that the robust nature of debate and ideology in France will save the day, I must say – when you look at the statistics in the US and other places, even in my own country Australia – that young people are not seeing the dividends from democracy, their world is very insecure.
They are disappointed by the fact that we no longer fund university education or adequately fund school education or our healthcare systems so that everybody has equal access. They are walking away from democracy at best. But they are actually distrustful of democracy in their own interests, at worst.
Democracy may be fluid, but if we are not conscious that it’s not a celebrity contest, it has to be a contest of political ideas and solutions and that there are some areas of work on which we need unity across political parties to create a future we can all agree with as a foundation, then we’re in trouble.
If you look at our global supply chains now, 94% of the workforce is a hidden workforce. They see how the major corporations take no responsibility, it is a low wage, insecure, often unsafe framework and we are even seeing slavery and informal work appear.
Now, those same CEOs will argue that they don’t have to take responsibility for their own due diligence to see that the profits are not made from the depravity of working conditions that no one would want their families to have to endure. I have worked with a group of CEOs who say, “We’re not perfect but we know the world has to change.” You know there is commitment to a new social contract from the business and the sustainable development commission. I was proud of that contract. But these are few, few companies.
So, if you cannot change the global economic model, if you cannot reinvest in people having a say through their democracy then it begs a whole set of questions about the inclusion of people for the future. We believe that peace and democracy are collateral damage of an increasingly fractured world. We have the solution, it is sustainable development goals, it is the Paris peace agreements, they char our course towards a zero poverty, zero carbon world.
Finland has started testing a universal basic income. Do you think that would be a way to restore some kind of equality?
In countries like Finland, their equality is driven from the fact that they have health, education, childcare, age care – they have essential social protection and vital public services frameworks. If, in addition to that, they could create the sheer prosperity from a tax base where corporations pay tax, people pay tax, then that is a very good model to consider.
But, what if we are going to give people a small amount of money from the public purse and then that absolves governments from responsibility for health and education, child care, age care – the essential social protections and public services for which people pay tax in the first place? If corporations will not pay tax – either because there are the informal platform businesses of the new economy that do not pay tax anywhere or they are old corporations that have learned how to evade tax – then it is not affordable.



Prof. Guy Standing: Every country can afford Universal Basic Income
99% of people want to improve their lives. And the UBI won’t prevent them from wanting it. So if such projects prevent them from having to do terrible jobs, this is positive, Guy Standing told EURACTIV Poland.


It is conscience cleaning, that’s what you are saying…
A few dollars in basic income versus the amount of redistribution possible when people build a collective society: they do not add up. The provision of the idea is fantastic as an additional shared element of prosperity, but it is a terrible idea for what it does is replace the social fabric of the guarantee of pensions, unemployment benefits, and those kinds of public services.
As an Australian who lives in Europe and is witnessing a changing European Union, if you had to explain to your compatriots in Australia, or elsewhere in the world, how the EU is changing, what would you point out as the EU’s strengths and weaknesses?
The traditional strength of the EU is the social model. If you can build the model of economy and society on shared prosperity, on fundamental rights, on dialogues and social inclusion, then that is the society you want.
The Nordic countries are still the most advanced, but Europe has actually built that model in principle. From 2010 at the G20 onwards, when they in fact decided that they had to engage in a round of austerity, you have seen that social model breaking down. And just last year, we saw a turnaround with the endorsement of the social pillar. Of course we need to see the social protocol and the legacy base that comes off of it. But that was the first indication that European politicians understand that they walked away from the fundamental social model that ensured people’s rights, inclusion to social protection, a good wage model that shared productivity through collective bargaining and social dialogue.
Hopefully, they are building it back up, because if the American corporate model wins, then we will have more of the same: people will retreat more and more into nationalistic solutions which once worked and you will see even more fracturing, and that is a disaster in a world that is already seeing such a risk of peace and democracy simply being collateral damage, of a world where people no longer matter.
That the corporate model has created such inequality that people do not see any secure future for themselves. 85% percent of the world’s people now say that they want the rules of the global economy rewritten. They know the world would be a better place if governments acted together, but they want the rules rewritten. Our method to Davos is twofold: change the rules, let’s secure a future. But for those people who have the courage, the small number of government leaders, the corporate, civil society and union leaders who have the courage and the commitment to push for a different model, raise your hand if you are prepared to be part of a negotiation on global solutions.

When you add that to the global risks which already exist – an economic model that has failed working people, a wave of misogyny that has further excluded women from the mainstream of equality, the question of a dominant model of low wages, insecure and unsafe work, distrust and the retreat into nationalism led by some leaders like Donald Trump – that actually is rendering the global economy even more unstable. Meanwhile, people are growing increasingly distrustful of all global institutions, whether it is global economy, multi-national, multilateral organizations, and their own government. We see a fractured world. It is not a base on which to build a future, unless we have people committed across government, business, civil society and unions to sit down and negotiate global solutions. And those global solutions have to be based on the sustainable development goals, which include jobs and decent work, fundamental human rights, equality for women and sustainability with the elimination of poverty. Last year, leaders in Davos agreed to more redistribution of wealth in order to fight the growing inequality caused by globalisation. One of the other WEF co-chairs, Christine Lagarde, warned years ago about the impact of rising inequality but remained mostly unheard. As this seems to have changed now, do you see any tangible results since January 2017? Public statements about risk have indeed been part of the analysis. But her institution has recommended austerity at every turn. They have attacked wage policies, they have attacked social protection. As recently as just a few months ago, the IMF’s advice to Iran was more of the same and people in Iran are now on the streets, because they do not trust governments, whether it is the current government or the reformists and they do not have the security of good jobs, of wages on which they can live with dignity, they are fighting for themselves and their children. Lagarde’s statements, although accurate on climate, on inequality, on women, are not the whole picture. Her own institution is still demanding conscriptions of governments on an economic and social front which is actually a part of the problem. It is not just the IMF, if you look across their multi-national institutions; you see the threat to the WTO and the very heart of international trade. We believe that the WTO has failed, because of the lack of political courage to actually deal with some of the issues like human rights, labour rights and environmental standards. Nevertheless, it is the institution that should be charged to do this and now it is in fact very vulnerable. When you look at the fracturing of political space at the national level, when you look at the vulnerability and, indeed, the lack of trust people now have in their multi-national institutions, we need to find negotiated solutions. EIB, WEF tell EU to embed social inclusion in economic policy At a time of rising inequality across Europe, the European Investment Bank and the World Economic Forum have jointly sounded the alarm bell and called for social inclusion to become an organic part of EU economic policy. But do you have the feeling that everything is a bit repetitive? They come together, they decide something, then they go back home and change does not happen as the courage is not there to implement what has been agreed. Change will not happen if the current model of corporate greed continues to dominate the future. The world became three times richer in the last three decades. And yet: When 84% of the worlds’ people cannot live on the minimum wage, when people are deeply anxious about employment and the security of employment, when you have major corporations – particularly American corporations – refusing to bargain with their workers to share productivity, then that level of greed is not just creating the one percent and vast inequality, it is putting the very economic model that these corporations have demanded in their own interests at risk. We know you have to change the rules and in fact, polling shows that 85% of the world’s population says you have to change the rules. And if you read the Global Risk Report, released by the World Economic Forum, it shows that they are simply deepening the already fractured world we live in. They are not just risks anymore; many of them are now having a serious impact. We need to change, we need a different future or the model of a world where we can be confident around an integrated future, where everybody has confidence to actually be part of our economy and society. For change, there needs to be leadership. With the election of Macron, we might have experienced this in a way, as he has completely uprooted the old political system and is trying to rebuild trust. Do you think there is a new type of leadership emerging? Democracy has to have the confidence of the people. You have to ask the question, whether his leadership in Europe is respected. If we do not have robust democracy, if we are not able to contest ideas, then ultimately democracy fails. And while I am confident that the robust nature of debate and ideology in France will save the day, I must say – when you look at the statistics in the US and other places, even in my own country Australia – that young people are not seeing the dividends from democracy, their world is very insecure. They are disappointed by the fact that we no longer fund university education or adequately fund school education or our healthcare systems so that everybody has equal access. They are walking away from democracy at best. But they are actually distrustful of democracy in their own interests, at worst. Democracy may be fluid, but if we are not conscious that it’s not a celebrity contest, it has to be a contest of political ideas and solutions and that there are some areas of work on which we need unity across political parties to create a future we can all agree with as a foundation, then we’re in trouble. If you look at our global supply chains now, 94% of the workforce is a hidden workforce. They see how the major corporations take no responsibility, it is a low wage, insecure, often unsafe framework and we are even seeing slavery and informal work appear. Now, those same CEOs will argue that they don’t have to take responsibility for their own due diligence to see that the profits are not made from the depravity of working conditions that no one would want their families to have to endure. I have worked with a group of CEOs who say, “We’re not perfect but we know the world has to change.” You know there is commitment to a new social contract from the business and the sustainable development commission. I was proud of that contract. But these are few, few companies. So, if you cannot change the global economic model, if you cannot reinvest in people having a say through their democracy then it begs a whole set of questions about the inclusion of people for the future. We believe that peace and democracy are collateral damage of an increasingly fractured world. We have the solution, it is sustainable development goals, it is the Paris peace agreements, they char our course towards a zero poverty, zero carbon world. Finland has started testing a universal basic income. Do you think that would be a way to restore some kind of equality? In countries like Finland, their equality is driven from the fact that they have health, education, childcare, age care – they have essential social protection and vital public services frameworks. If, in addition to that, they could create the sheer prosperity from a tax base where corporations pay tax, people pay tax, then that is a very good model to consider. But, what if we are going to give people a small amount of money from the public purse and then that absolves governments from responsibility for health and education, child care, age care – the essential social protections and public services for which people pay tax in the first place? If corporations will not pay tax – either because there are the informal platform businesses of the new economy that do not pay tax anywhere or they are old corporations that have learned how to evade tax – then it is not affordable. Prof. Guy Standing: Every country can afford Universal Basic Income 99% of people want to improve their lives. And the UBI won’t prevent them from wanting it. So if such projects prevent them from having to do terrible jobs, this is positive, Guy Standing told EURACTIV Poland. It is conscience cleaning, that’s what you are saying… A few dollars in basic income versus the amount of redistribution possible when people build a collective society: they do not add up. The provision of the idea is fantastic as an additional shared element of prosperity, but it is a terrible idea for what it does is replace the social fabric of the guarantee of pensions, unemployment benefits, and those kinds of public services. As an Australian who lives in Europe and is witnessing a changing European Union, if you had to explain to your compatriots in Australia, or elsewhere in the world, how the EU is changing, what would you point out as the EU’s strengths and weaknesses? The traditional strength of the EU is the social model. If you can build the model of economy and society on shared prosperity, on fundamental rights, on dialogues and social inclusion, then that is the society you want. The Nordic countries are still the most advanced, but Europe has actually built that model in principle. From 2010 at the G20 onwards, when they in fact decided that they had to engage in a round of austerity, you have seen that social model breaking down. And just last year, we saw a turnaround with the endorsement of the social pillar. Of course we need to see the social protocol and the legacy base that comes off of it. But that was the first indication that European politicians understand that they walked away from the fundamental social model that ensured people’s rights, inclusion to social protection, a good wage model that shared productivity through collective bargaining and social dialogue. Hopefully, they are building it back up, because if the American corporate model wins, then we will have more of the same: people will retreat more and more into nationalistic solutions which once worked and you will see even more fracturing, and that is a disaster in a world that is already seeing such a risk of peace and democracy simply being collateral damage, of a world where people no longer matter. That the corporate model has created such inequality that people do not see any secure future for themselves. 85% percent of the world’s people now say that they want the rules of the global economy rewritten. They know the world would be a better place if governments acted together, but they want the rules rewritten. Our method to Davos is twofold: change the rules, let’s secure a future. But for those people who have the courage, the small number of government leaders, the corporate, civil society and union leaders who have the courage and the commitment to push for a different model, raise your hand if you are prepared to be part of a negotiation on global solutions. Juncker’s trade push starts with Australia, New Zealand As anticipated in recent weeks, trade topped the Juncker Commission’s priorities for the rest of its mandate.",21

                Does money influence the way we think and act, even unconsciously? Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman believes so and few places on Earth contain more reminders of money and power than the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos.
Referring to research conducted by psychologist Kathleen Vohs, he explains that people who have been exposed to reminders of money (from words to screensavers with dollar bills) were more “independent” and “selfish” compared to those untouched by these associative triggers.
Now, cross over to the Swiss Alps and the mountain town of Davos.
In front of the cameras, panellists will talk about how to improve national outputs or avoid cohorts of jobless citizens due to automation. Behind closed doors, global CEOs will close multimillion-dollar deals, politicians will fight to attract foreign investment and entrepreneurs will seek to seduce venture capitalists, all in an atmosphere fuelled by fancy cocktails and attendees bragging about partying like rock stars.
So is the money-primed Davos audience more independent and selfish than the average man on the street?
Some clues have come from Klaus Schwab, the man responsible for bringing 70 heads of state and government and some of the most powerful businessmen to the Swiss resort.
When he introduced this year’s edition, the founder and executive chairman of the WEF called for “new models for cooperation that are not based on narrow interests but on the destiny of humanity as a whole”.
While millions of citizens across the world have lost their jobs and/or houses because of the crisis, bankers and CEOs barely noticed the great recession.
Not only that, the Forum blames economists and policymakers for contributing to this inequality by their “excessive reliance” on GDP as the main metric to measure the economy over social equity indicators.
The result has been “missing out on a virtuous circle in which growth is strengthened by being shared”, a report published by the forum today said.
Meanwhile, billionaires’ wealth increased by an annual average of 13% since 2010, six times faster than the wages of ordinary workers (2%), alerted Oxfam in another report ahead of Davos.
The victory of Donald Trump, the UK’s exit from the EU and the protests against globalisation sparked serious concerns among the global elite last year.
But the bullish economy has this year trashed any attempt at action.
As a result, on the tenth anniversary of the Lehman Brothers crash, all the “systemic challenges”, including inequality, populism and nationalism, have intensified, the forum warned in its risk report before the gathering started.
The result? Uncertainty, instability and fragility continue to run free.
This year not only represents a landmark anniversary since the biggest crisis in three generations. The protests of May ’68 in France should also serve as a powerful reminder of what could happen if the status quo continues to be justified as the result of forces (globalisation, automation, capitalism) beyond anyone’s control.
If those who control the world of politics and finance fail to tame these wild horses, those left behind, including ordinary workers and young people, will eventually decide to fight for their fair share of the cake, just as they did fifty years ago.
Popular revolts are hard to predict because you never know what may be the trigger.
For some, the revolt in France started when former MEP Daniel Cohn-Bendit reproached French minister François Missoffe for his omission of sexual relations among students in his white paper on youth.
This time around, the fuel is ominously awaiting a spark.
Salaries have been falling around the globe since 2012, warns the International Labour Organisation. Although disparities between countries are decreasing, inequality within nations has increased since the early 1990s, when globalisation picked up speed, especially in advanced economies.
This year’s Davos forum will be a lot about visions and narratives, as Trump and Europe promise to clash over their versions of globalisation and multilateralism. But words and well-intended speeches are no longer enough. Bold actions are needed to prove that money is not the only thing on their minds.
The Roundup
Poland hopes that its new foreign minister will be able to find some common ground with the Commission over the Article 7 procedure after he met with right-hand of Juncker Frans Timmermans on Sunday.
The other member state in the EU executive’s bad books, Hungary, might have to delay expanding its nuclear power plant after neighbouring Austria said it would take the Commission to court after Berlaymont HQ signed off on the controversial project.
It’s the 55th anniversary of the landmark Elysee Treaty and we might be on the cusp of a reboot of Franco-German relations. Germany might soon have a government to make those kinds of decisions after the Socialists narrowly supported continuing in earnest with coalition talks.
There were protests all over Europe at the weekend. Romanians braved the cold streets of Bucharest to march once more against government corruption. Greeks turned out in the north of country to rally over the ongoing Macedonia name row.
The co-chair of the Davos World Economic Forum warned EURACTIV Editor-in-Chief Daniela Vincenti that greed remains the primary economic engine of the world. Keep up to date with all the developments from the Swiss Alps this week with our liveblog.
Malta’s energy isolation is costing the island nation an arm and a leg in import costs, while Britain’s post-Brexit green protections look in severe doubt, according to environmental groups.

                Athens does not feel any external pressure to find a solution to the name dispute with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), Greek Minister of Foreign Affairs Nikos Kotzias said on Monday (22 January).
On the contrary, the pressure is on Skopje to end the dispute in order to move forward its EU accession talks, he claimed.
“No one is pushing us. Nor will we allow anyone to do so. The Greek diplomacy takes advantage of the pressure on the other side [which aims] to open up its EU path. This is not putting pressure on us,” Kotzias said.
Speaking following a meeting of EU Foreign Affairs Ministers, Kotzias pointed out that the protests that took place in the country opposing the inclusion of the name “Macedonia” won’t affect the ongoing negotiations.
“The protest was an expression of the anguish of Greeks, who sometimes mistakenly identify the negotiation with the fate of Greek Macedonia,” the Greek official said.
On 21 January, more than 90,000 demonstrators took to the streets of Thessaloniki asking the government not to negotiate a name that would include the term “Macedonia”.



Tens of thousands join Greek protest over Macedonia name row
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets of northern Greece’s biggest city Thessaloniki on Sunday (21 January), police said, in a long-running row between Athens and Skopje over the use of the name Macedonia.


Athens argues that the name Macedonia suggests that Skopje has territorial claims to the northern Greek region of the same name, of which Thessaloniki is the capital.
FYROM’s prime minister, Zoran Zaev, will meet Greek counterpart Alexis Tsipras on 24 January on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos.



Tensions grow before biggest secret is revealed: FYROM's new name
The opposition VMRO-DPMNE of former Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski in Skopje, possibly encouraged by Russia, is trying to hinder the resolution of a name dispute with Greece that has blocked the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia’s (FYROM) progress in joining NATO and the European Union.


Turmoil in Greek politics 
In the meantime, the Greek government clashed with the main opposition New Democracy party, an affiliate of the European People’s Party (EPP), over the protest in Thessaloniki.
Centre-right New Democracy leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis said that the participation in the protest was “impressive”.
“I respect and share the sensitivity of the people on the issue,” he said, adding that the protest also expressed the indignation of the citizens towards a government that moves in secret.
Previously, Mitsotakis had said that it was a personal decision of each member of the party to participate or not in the protest. Some members of the party, who are elected in Northern Greece, indeed took part.
Opposition parties are also irritated by the right-wing junior coalition partner Independent Greeks, who have announced they would not support a solution that includes the name “Macedonia”.
The ruling leftist party Syriza insists that their government partner will ultimately follow the common line. They accuse the opposition of not having a joint position on the name dispute due to some “extreme-right” members in its ranks.
This left government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos wondering: “Will he finally act with responsibility in respect of his institutional role and the Karamanlis government’s position in 2007-2008 or he will continue the short-sighted and nationally damaging line of undermining the effort to find a solution that Mr Samaras wants to impose on him?”
At the NATO Bucharest summit in 2008, Greece’s right-wing prime minister, Kostas Karamanlis (New Democracy), blocked Skopje’s bid to join NATO under its provisional name FYROM.



'Old' and 'new' Europe divided at NATO Summit
EU divisions were apparent on the eve of the NATO summit in Bucharest on 2-4 April with several heavyweights, including France, opposed to the planned Eastern expansion of the military alliance. EURACTIV Romania contributed to this report from Bucharest.


At the time, the government insisted on a compound name before the word “Macedonia” to be used in relation to everyone (erga omnes). This is also the position of the leftist Syriza.
Antonis Samaras was the minister of foreign affairs under the government of Konstantinos Mitsotakis, the father of Kyriakos Mitsotakis who governed the country from 1990 to 1993.
Back then, Samaras, who is still a New Democracy lawmaker, disagreed with the inclusion of the term Macedonia and for this reason, broke up from the party leading to the collapse of Mitsotakis government.



Commission expects ‘concrete’ results on Macedonian name dispute
The European Commission welcomed the action taken by the government in Skopje to end a 25-year stalemate on a name dispute with Greece and now hopes to see “concrete results”, a spokesperson told EURACTIV.com on Thursday (4 January).


In the European Parliament, one influential German lawmaker called on New Democracy politicians to stop the “dog fights” and give their leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis a chance to implement his ambitious program for the country against Tsipras populism.
Speaking to EURACTIV on condition of anonymity, the German lawmaker referred to Antonis Samaras saying, “He overthrew Mitsotakis’s father […] why couldn’t he do the same to the son as well?”

If anything, European policymakers are engaging in their own form of dishonest, hysterical yellow news policymaking, argues William Echikson.","https://www.euractiv.com/section/media4eu/opinion/the-eus-fake-news-fraud/","By William Echikson | Centre for European Policy Studies 23-01-2018","
                The European Commission has launched a crusade against what it calls one of the scourges of our time – fake news. But the war against fake news is exaggerated and overwrought, argues William Echikson.
William Echikson heads the Digital Forum at the Centre for European Policy Studies (CEPS), a think tank.
On 9 January, five Commissioners summoned Internet companies to their headquarters and threatened them with legislation unless they took swift, decisive additional actions to fight deliberate misinformation or hoaxes. On 15 January, the Commission inaugurated a high-level expert group to determine what type of actions are required. 
But this war against fake news is exaggerated and overwrought. If anything, European policymakers are engaging in their own form of dishonest, hysterical yellow news policymaking. 
Fake news is not an Internet creation; it has existed since ancient times.  Traditional tabloids are just as responsible as digital social media for spreading deliberate misinformation. More important, new research shows that the impact of fake news on elections is minimal. And Internet giants such as Google and Facebook are moving fast to block made up stories. 
The case for combatting Internet-spread fake news seems simple: digital technology accelerates the spread of disinformation. Websites compete to attract viewers and advertising. If publishing a story with false content attracts viewers, it is good business. Hostile governments such as Russia are motivated by non-monetary goals; they use propaganda to increase political polarization and undermine democracy.  
None of this dangerous disinformation is new. In the 13th century BC, Ramses the Great spread lies and propaganda portraying the Battle of Kadesh as a stunning victory for the Egyptians. The battle was actually a stalemate. In 1475, a fake news story in Trent claimed that the Jewish community had murdered a two-and-a-half-year-old Christian infant named Simonino. The story resulted in all the Jews in the city being arrested and tortured. 
If anyone still believes that the present-day threat of fake news represents civilisation’s most dangerous encounter with lies, just compare with the example of Nazi propaganda. An exhibition from the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum opens on 25 January at the European Parliament’s Parliamentarium. 
Titled “State of Deception: The Power of Nazi Propaganda,” it examines how the Nazis leveraged propaganda to win broad voter support in Germany’s young democracy and go on to implement radical programs under the party’s dictatorship in the 1930s, and justify war and mass murder. 
In comparison, today’s fake news seems almost benign. Yes, British tabloids nourished Brexit. They drew on the United Kingdom’s deep-suited ambivalence about the European Union. Yes, Fox News fed Trumpian populism and racism. It drew on deep-seated anxiety among white working classes toward economic and social change sweeping the United States.
Did the fake news drive the US 2016 election results? Three eminent political science researchers this month posted an analysis of the browsing histories of thousands of adults during the run-up to the 2016 election. They found that fake news indeed had a wide yet weak reach. One in four Americans saw at least one false story, but even the most eager fake-news readers — Trump supporters — consumed far more of the real kind, from newspaper and network websites.
Internet giants are counterattacking, with significant success. At a presentation in Brussels this month, Google’s head of search Ben Gomes explained how the company’s algorithm has been changed to favour “authoritative” sources over “relevance.” What this means is clear: rather than get a direct answer to a query from a dubious source, readers now are linked with an authoritative one from Politico or other establishment websites. 
Before, the question “Did the Holocaust Happen?” returned a revisionist claim that the genocide never happened. Today, it returns a page from the US Holocaust Museum. “While we never can get rid of all fake news, I think we are now one step ahead of the problem,” Gomes said, estimating that less than one percent of all Google queries are directed to scandal-mongering sites. 
Facebook is taking similar aim at fake news sites. Last year, it updated the language in its Facebook Audience Network policy, which already says it will not display ads in sites that show misleading or illegal content, to include fake news sites. This year, it is prioritizing what their friends and family share and comment on while de-emphasizing content from publishers and brands.
Given these actions, what is the right policy response? It certainly is not Germany’s new Net Enforcement Law (NetzDG), which increases the liability of social media networks to check and remove false and hate speech or face a €50 million fine. 
This law’s overreach already has resulted in mass takedowns, including of respectable German politicians such as Justice Minister Heiko Mass. Twitter removed his tweet calling an author who opposes immigration an “idiot.”  That’s not fake news.
            ","The European Commission has launched a crusade against what it calls one of the scourges of our time – fake news. But the war against fake news is exaggerated and overwrought, argues William Echikson. William Echikson heads the Digital Forum at the Centre for European Policy Studies (CEPS), a think tank. On 9 January, five Commissioners summoned Internet companies to their headquarters and threatened them with legislation unless they took swift, decisive additional actions to fight deliberate misinformation or hoaxes. On 15 January, the Commission inaugurated a high-level expert group to determine what type of actions are required. But this war against fake news is exaggerated and overwrought. If anything, European policymakers are engaging in their own form of dishonest, hysterical yellow news policymaking. Fake news is not an Internet creation; it has existed since ancient times. Traditional tabloids are just as responsible as digital social media for spreading deliberate misinformation. More important, new research shows that the impact of fake news on elections is minimal. And Internet giants such as Google and Facebook are moving fast to block made up stories. The case for combatting Internet-spread fake news seems simple: digital technology accelerates the spread of disinformation. Websites compete to attract viewers and advertising. If publishing a story with false content attracts viewers, it is good business. Hostile governments such as Russia are motivated by non-monetary goals; they use propaganda to increase political polarization and undermine democracy. None of this dangerous disinformation is new.

                This article is part of our special report Davos 2018 debates ‘shared future in a fractured world’.The global economy is growing faster than expected, fuelling CEO optimism as they arrive this week at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland.
But the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that the next crisis will hit sooner and harder that we thought.
“In seed time learn, in harvest teach, in winter enjoy,” said IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde, issuing a warning by quoting British poet William Blake to describe the state of mind of businessmen and politicians in the world.
The global economy continues to beat previous forecasts. The Fund revised upward by 0.2% the growth expected for this year and next. In Europe, the IMF increased further its outlook by 0.3% in 2018 (2.2%) and in 2019 (2%).
But “complacency is one of the risks we should go against”, Lagarde told reporters in Davos hours before the official opening of the WEF.
The economy is growing but not because countries have lifted their growth potential via investment in human capital or technology. Instead, reforms have been elusive and growth has benefited just the few that are on top of the pile.



The Brief – Money on our minds
Does money influence the way we think and act, even unconsciously? Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman believes so and few places on Earth contain more reminders of money and power than the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos.


“We are not satisfied,” Lagarde insisted, because “too many people have been left out of the acceleration of growth”.
Against the backdrop of fragile growth and outstanding challenges, including a high level of debt, the Fund’s chief economist, Maurice Obstfeld, stressed that “the next recession will come sooner and will be harder to fight”.
He warned political leaders that the economic momentum is due to factors that are “unlikely to last for long”, including the monetary stimulus and supportive fiscal stance.
For that reason, he urged countries to adopt measures aimed at improving the resilience of their societies in the fast-changing digital revolution and to improve the inclusiveness of their societies.
Obstfeld welcomed that an important number of European countries have implemented “important” structural reforms since the 2007/8 crisis, including Spain and Italy, while French President Emmanuel Macron promised “quite ambitious measures”.
Fiscal capacity
Looking at the eurozone reform, he said that the completion of the banking union, with an European Deposit Insurance Scheme would represent a step forward, as it would be also the case of completing the economic and monetary union with a fiscal capacity.
Growing inequality and persistent uncertainty and instability on the planet will be overarching concerns at this year’s forum.
The incapability of traditional parties to better distribute economic gains led to the rise of anti-establishment parties and populist forces across the world. Donald Trump won the elections in the US appealing to those ‘left behind’ by globalisation.
But “a turn to more nationalistic or authoritarian governance models, however, could result in stalled economic reforms at home and a withdrawal from cross-border economic integration,” warned the IMF days before Trump’s arrival to Davos.
It is unclear even for business leaders how the buoyant economic situation has helped their societies.
Not benefiting all
According to a global survey presented on Monday by consultancy firm PwC in Davos, 46% of CEOs of around 1,300 companies consulted believe that the world is registering a concentrated economic growth benefiting only a few people, while 48% described the economic growth as widespread.
The global president of PwC, Bob Moritz, told reporters that, regardless of what side they are on, CEOs are starting to become aware of the problem and “they are ready to take action”.
But despite persistent inequality and social unrest, the sense of urgency to act decreases as the world economy, in particular advanced economies, continues to improve gross domestic product (GDP) outlooks for the upcoming years.



Business leaders optimistic about future, despite popular discontent
Top business executives are split over the benefits of globalisation, but most remain “extremely positive” in their growth forecasts, a PwC survey shows.


A total of 57% of company presidents interviewed were confident about the global economy for this year, 28 points more than in 2017.
The failure of GDP
For that reason, the WEF recommended on Monday to start looking at the economy in a different manner, to include indicators to measure not only what economies generate, but also the distribution of wealth and income, life expectancy, productivity, debt levels or unemployment levels.
“Decades of prioritising economic growth over social equity has led to historically high levels of wealth and income inequality and caused governments to miss out on a virtuous circle in which growth is strengthened by being shared more widely and generated without unduly straining the environment or burdening future generations,” according to Forum experts.
In a report published on Monday, the WEF blamed economists and policy makers for their “excessive reliance” on GDP.
CEOs surveyed by PwC agreed that financial indicators are not enough to create a true picture of the economic situation.
Financial indicators “cannot be the only measure of success in a globalised economy. Other, broader measures, reflecting target outcomes in societal terms, must also be considered,” said Moritz.



WEF co-chair: Greed is still the economic engine
In an increasingly fractured world, change will not happen if the current model of corporate greed continues to dominate the future, 2018 World Economic Forum co-chair Sharan Burrow told EURACTIV in an exclusive interview.


Obstfeld admitted that economists have struggled to measure wealth distribution. But he argued that GDP should remain as an “anchor”, completed by other indicators to reflect societal aspects or the environmental costs of productions.
“It is not possible to produce one single number to summarise people’s happiness,” he said.

                Moscow’s influence within EU member states worries MEPs. While the main political groups condemn the interference of the Kremlin, Eurosceptics have no qualms about defending Vladimir Putin. EURACTIV France reports.
Elmar Brock was quick to set the tone of the debate on Russian propaganda during the European Parliament’s January plenary session. “By defending Russia, some here are defending their ideology which is not that of a liberal democracy,” the centre-right German MEP said in reference to the remarks made by Eurosceptic parties.
MEPs from all political families engaged for two hours in a veritable verbal sparring match on the influence of Russian disinformation.
Pro-European parties stated their wish to see truth triumph and to better spread the EU’s strategic communication plan, to which the Eurosceptic lawmakers answer was that there was no concrete evidence of disinformation from Russia.
The populist and far-right parties have nothing to gain from criticising Vladimir Putin’s regime as they receive his political support, and some even his financial support.  Besides, they share common ideologies with Moscow, and above all a common objective: dividing Europe. Therefore, the hybrid war of disinformation is a tool to reach this objective.



Putin supports far-right to divide Europe: Timmermans
Vladimir Putin is cozying up to the far-right to divide Europe, the European Commission’s Vice President Frans Timmermans said yesterday (30 March), a week after France’s Marine Le Pen met with the Russian leader.


The debate has notably been fed by accusations of interference by Russian agents in the votes on Brexit and Catalonia’s independence. For MEPs of the radical left and the Parliament’s extreme right-wing Europe of Nations and Freedom group (ENL), this argument is only a means to create a distraction.
“Are you so unaware of people’s perceptions to think that citizens would be influenced by Moscow when voting?” asked Mario Borghezio, an Italian ENL member.
Gerard Batten, a British UKIP MEP, added: “Mr. Putin is a gangster who rules over a gangster state: he spends millions to undermine western democracies, but you are looking for a scapegoat to explain the EU’s unpopularity. You are diverting attention. Putin is not the cause of your unpopularity.”
EU Credibility
MEPs agreed on one thing: before denouncing Russia, the EU should tread carefully and clean up its own act.
For Slovenian Social-Democrat MEP Tanja Fajon (S&D group), if we criticise Russian propaganda it is unfair not to do the same for Fox News, for example, or national media outlets tied to political figures. “As a parliament we must stay credible.”
David McAllister of the EPP stressed that this fight against disinformation must start within the Parliament. “MEP’s have used technical infrastructures here to spread information on Russia Today. Can we criticise disinformation campaigns, but support media that facilitate propaganda?”
The channel Russia Today, already available in German, English and Spanish, has started to broadcast in French in December and continues to hire journalists. As for Sputnik, the other Russian media outlet criticised by French President Emmanuel Macron last year, the online newspaper presents itself as the mouthpiece of MEPs who had previously shouted down the “pretentious paranoia” against “supposed Russian interference”.



Russian propaganda machine to launch French TV channel
Russian Television (RT) will start broadcasting from Paris in December, as the Kremlin steps up its information war. EURACTIV France reports.


As for David Coburn (UKIP), he emphasised that the EU was also taking part in the propaganda war. “What about the millions spent on the promotion of the Lisbon Treaty? What about the campaign against Brexit? I am stunned by this European disinformation, even more so than by the Russian version.”
Multiplying resources
The European Commission has set up a group of experts on fake news, they gathered for the first time on 15 January. Made up of 39 members, these experts are in charge of finding a definition of the phenomenon and providing the Commission with means to tackle it.
For the moment, the tools offered by Brussels to tackle the war on Russian disinformation are weak compared to the tools put in place by the Kremlin.
In 2015, the European executive also put together the East StratCom working force. Made up of just 17 people however, their resources are limited compared to the millions of euros invested into disinformation by Vladimir Putin.
Spanish MEP Esteban Gonzalez Pons (EPP group), reckons that: “We need to react more seriously against this network of ghost Russian soldiers ready to diffuse disinformation. With the East StratCom task force we are defenceless.”
It has to be said that Russian fake news is spread at the level of national politics. Vladimir Putin unhesitatingly allocates €300 million per year to disinformation, and within Russian military circles, this is a legitimate weapon.



Russian official: Information war part of ‘battle for the consciousness of the masses’
The new propaganda and cyber-warfare division of Russia’s ministry of defence is staffed by 1,000 people and has a budget of €300 million. Special efforts are being made to target the French presidential election. Euractiv France reports.


According to the Latvian MEP Roberts Zile of the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR group): “Russia is successfully involved in this media war. We are not always aware of the scope of the lies.”
Sandra Kalniete of the EPP added: “We need to correctly finance the European cybersecurity agency, improve the budget. In other words the budget needs to be multiplied by ten. Moreover, I would like to congratulate the East StratCom task force, but I regret that it is under-funded and that it doesn’t have enough personnel at its disposal.”
Strengthen journalism and educate
In response to this hybrid war, the MEPs suggest developing an authentic European media policy. According to them, quality journalism and media education are key. Citizens need to learn to read media and know who is behind the information. Improving the transparency of media funding and the sources of information is a big part of this battle.
German Green MEP Rebecca Harms stated: “The EU needs to strengthen journalism, now suffering as result of fake news. If social media such as Facebook and Twitter start to replace journalists, they need to respect the same rules.”
Julian King, the European Commissioner for Security, was present during the debate and recalled that the Commission had opened a public consultation on fake news, which ends on 23 February. “The aim of this campaign is to show that fake news is real. We need to knock down this propaganda”.
“Let’s not forget to protect pluralism and the freedom of the press which are pillars of our democracy,” he concluded.

                The EU’s justice commissioner is working on a proposal that could oblige member states such as Poland, which has clashed with Brussels over the controversial reforms of its courts, to pass tests on the independence of their judicial systems before receiving funding.
Věra Jourová said there was agreement within the executive European Commission to work on ideas to encourage strong judiciaries in planning for the new budget from 2021.
“One way could be to insist that independent justice systems are necessary for effective control of the use of EU funds,” she said. “I would like to propose that link.”



The Brief: The secret weapon against rogue countries
At his first EU summit last week French President Emmanuel Macron signalled that there will be a change of attitude vis-à-vis the EU’s ‘rogue countries’.


A Commission spokesman said on Monday (21 January) the work by Jourová was part of broader preparations for a new, seven-year EU budget plan, due to be published in May, and was in line with policy outlines the EU executive has put forward since last year.
The remarks by Jourová, the Commission’s Czech member, come as the EU executive is challenging Poland, a major recipient of Union funds, to amend judicial reforms which Brussels says will hurt democracy and its oversight of EU trading rules.
Facing the prospect of filling a hole left in the budget by Britain’s exit from the EU, and irritated by Poland and other governments in the ex-communist east on a range of issues, some wealthy Western governments have pushed for a clearer link between getting subsidies and abiding by EU standards.
The German commissioner in charge of the budget, Günther Oettinger, warned Poland this month that it could lose some of its €7 billion annual funding if it fails to heed Brussels’ complaints about undermining the rule of law.



Germany to propose cutting funds to EU members that violate rule of law
European Union members that fail to meet EU standards on the rule of law could lose access to its financing under German proposals for the reform of the cohesion fund system seen by Reuters yesterday (30 May).


More broadly, Jourová is also hoping for a review of EU policy on judicial standards in the second half of this year. EU officials say that might, for example, include regular reviews of the performance of national justice systems, along the lines of existing biennial reviews of government economic policies, which are meant to promote “convergence” toward EU-wide goals.
As a former national official handling the regional funding that is a key part of EU efforts to bring poor regions closer to the prosperity of others, Jourová stressed that she saw any new rules applying to all EU funding for all states, not just to so-called “cohesion” policy. She also said it should not be seen as a punitive measure but designed to encourage good practice.



Katainen: For cohesion as well as migration, solidarity is not a one-way street
Commission Vice-President Jyrki Katainen reminded the Visegrád countries today (28 March) that the solidarity they expect from the EU’s cohesion policy also applies to the refugee crisis.


She also said the discussion on the proposals could be used to help simplify some of the hurdles to applying for EU funds.
Any Commission proposal seen as too radical by EU capitals risks being killed off by the member states.
            ","The EU’s justice commissioner is working on a proposal that could oblige member states such as Poland, which has clashed with Brussels over the controversial reforms of its courts, to pass tests on the independence of their judicial systems before receiving funding. Věra Jourová said there was agreement within the executive European Commission to work on ideas to encourage strong judiciaries in planning for the new budget from 2021. “One way could be to insist that independent justice systems are necessary for effective control of the use of EU funds,” she said. “I would like to propose that link.” The Brief: The secret weapon against rogue countries At his first EU summit last week French President Emmanuel Macron signalled that there will be a change of attitude vis-à-vis the EU’s ‘rogue countries’.

                After last year’s push from China to champion itself as the saviour of globalisation and lure international investors, this year it was the turn of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to slam protectionism and showcase a ‘new India’ to global chief executives gathered in Davos.
“Forces of protectionism are raising their heads against globalisation, their intention is not only to avoid globalisation themselves but they also want to reverse its natural flow,” he told business and political leaders in the Swiss Alpine resort.
Globalisation is accepting change and shape it
“The result of all this is that we get to witness new types of tariff and non-tariff barriers. Bilateral and multilateral trade agreements and negotiations have come to a kind of standstill. Most nations have seen a decrease in cross-border financial investment further, growth in the global supply chain has also stopped,” he added, stressing the need to accept change and formulate agile and flexible policies in line with the changing times.
Modi’s trip is the first visit by an Indian prime minister to Davos in more than two decades and he made repeated references to 1997, when Deve Gowda joined the Forum, Harry Potter was an unheard name, tweeting was done only by birds and Amazon referred to forests.
He arrived in Davos with the largest-ever Indian delegation, comprising six ministers and more than 100 CEOs, including Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, and Commerce and Industry Minister Suresh Prabhu.
Modi was not shy to underline the difference from the other big player, China. “One-sixth of the global community lives in India and is a very diverse society that has a common vision; for a shared future. This is our real strength. We are trying to harness it and strengthen it further,” he noted, pointing at India as the world’s largest democracy and the fastest-growing major economy.



EU must demand respect for human rights in trade talks with India
The Indian government must guarantee the security of religious minorities if it wants to conclude trade deals with the EU, writes Lars Adaktusson.


Overtaking G7 countries and China
India’s economy has been predicted to overtake that of Britain and France by next year, becoming the fifth largest economy in the world, according to a report by the Centre for Economics and Business Research.
India is now the world’s fastest-growing large economy and probably will be for years, if not decades, to come. The World Economic Forum has underlined that India will also outgrow China in 2018, if it manages to invest in the next generation value chain.
The IMF forecasts growth of 7.4% for India in 2018, with international banks returning a range of predictions running from a low of 7% (Standard Chartered and HSBC) to a high of 7.5% (Nomura and HSBC). China’s maturing economy is unlikely ever again to match such high growth numbers.
Once poverty-stricken and reliant on international aid, India opened up its economy in the early 1990s and has since seen steady, sometimes remarkable, economic growth. Today, by most measures, India is one of the world’s largest and fastest-growing economies.
“India is an investment in future,” he launched, highlighting the vibrant and youthful society, the large number of Tech manpower and the third largest consumer market in the world by 2025.
The offensive was clearly visible all over Davos. Posters showing Modi unrolling the red carpet or making India’s business case towered over the congress centre. Hundreds of Indian businessmen were there to craft the narrative of a new India.
Invest India and the department of industrial policy and promotion (DIPP) is shaping the ‘New India’ campaign hat highlights the massive opportunities through a large market, an economy estimated to touch $5 trillion and a middle class of 550 million in 2025.
The government wants to pitch India as an attractive investment destination, with strong economic fundamentals and a regime pushing reforms such as GST and improving governance through a “technology-driven transparent” approach.
“If you want wealth with wellness, work in India. If you want peace and prosperity, live in India. If you want health with whole life, be in India. And our promise is that your agenda will be part of our destiny,” he ended.
But if India is really serious about boosting its attractiveness, it should start by delivering on a trade agreement already underway.
India and the EU have been negotiating a bilateral free trade and investment agreement (BTIA) since June 2007 and have missed several deadlines to conclude the talks due to unresolved issues mostly related to market access.



EU, India dust off promise for a trade deal
EU and India leaders promised to take their trade relationship ‘to the next level’ as they met during a summit in New Delhi on Friday (6 October) – but with some strings attached.


The 2017 EU-India Summit, some observers underline, stands as a watershed moment in the relationship’s timeline having transformed EU-India ties into a veritable strategic partnership by securing it firmly onto two new forward-looking pillars – a platform for climate and energy cooperation and a partnership on sustainable urbanisation.
 



EU-India relations come full-circle
For more than a decade, the EU and India partnership had been slow-moving and fragmented, struggling to maintain momentum. The last EU-India summit however shows EU-India relations have come full circle, writes Gauri Khandekar.


The summit also registered a pledge by the European Investment Bank to invest a further €800m in solar projects across India and the conclusion of a mobility agreement for young scientists and researchers.

                Despite winning the Nobel Peace Prize five years ago, the EU is no longer “a great actor of peace”. It should not rush into creating its own army unless the US decides to pull back its troops, Dan Smith told EURACTIV.com in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos.
Dan Smith is the director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. He spoke to EURACTIV.com’s Editor-in-Chief Daniela Vincenti.
We have gathered here in Davos for a good look at the economic situation. Yet we have a lot of challenges on the security side. Do you think they live in delusion?
Well, I think there is no doubt that on peace and security, the global indicators are moving in the wrong direction. Military spending is up, the arms trade is up, and although there are far fewer nuclear weapons than there were at the end of the Cold War, nuclear arms control negotiations are basically inactive at the moment. The number of nuclear weapon states has just increased as North Korea has become a confirmed nuclear weapon state in the last year also. So, I think that seen on the security side the world does not look in a good state at the moment.
There is obviously a big question on the Iran deal with Donald Trump wanting to withdraw. How do you see that shaping up? Will they manage to maintain this or not, the EU especially?
There are two scenarios, aren’t there? One is that the US actually pulls out of the deal. The difficulty then will be that Iran does not get the access to the international trading and financing system that they want, and what was part of the incentives for going into the joint comprehensive plan of action in the first place. That would certainly make it much more difficult if the US would pull out.
But at present, the EU institutionally and individual governments – including, what would many people surprise, the UK government – but also the French, the German and obviously the Russians are all standing very firm in favour of continuing with the agreement. So, the more optimistic scenario is that President Trump continues to say critical things about JCPA every three months, but the US doesn’t actually take any action over it. In either circumstance, I think that what is really important is that the detailed work is done that goes as far as possible to paving the way for Iran to complete its re-entry into the world trading system. And some of the work needs to be done by Iran itself on transparency and compliance within its own banking system.
There is a line of argument that the recent demonstrations and protests, mobilisations in Iran were as much as anything about corruption in the banking industry, which tells you that here is something which the Iranian government needs to fix. And if it does fix it, it will not only have greater internal stability, but it will have greater international access as well.
You talked about the EU forcefully trying to maintain this deal and working behind the scenes. Do you see in the last 3-4 years a different EU in terms of security? They are working towards a defence union, especially since Brexit, do you see a totally different player?
I see the possibility of a very different player in the last year and a half. I think of the EU enthusiasm for integration: we’ve been talking about a defence union since the 1970s or maybe even earlier. And always the rhetoric and the aspirations far outstripped what they were actually willing to do in practice. Regardless of Brexit, you have to take into account the fact that NATO is there, NATO is the security architecture for Western Europe and that involves the US.
So when President Trump was elected, given his background of being highly critical of NATO and saying it was outmoded and anyway all NATO members owe America money for having stationed its forces in Europe for all of these years. There was a lot of consternation in NATO and NATO governments and I think even in the non-alligned governments in Europe about what was actually going to happen now.
Is the equation going to be completely changed? I think it is not surprising then to hear things being said freely. I remember Angela Merkel last year talking about how Europe needs to get along without relying on some of its oldest and closest allies, and I think that is new. But what will play out in practice? I remain open-minded as to what is going to happen. I am not convinced that it will do, but we will see.
At the moment, what are they thinking when they are talking about the defence union is pooling to get a lot of military capabilities but not really creating a real European army. Do you think Europe needs a European army?
At the moment: No. If you were to look at this from a defence efficiency point of view, there are gains that Europe can make that are way short of a European army by further cooperation between different national units. At the moment, with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation there, that’s for good or real, that’s the security architecture Europe has and if a European army were injected into that equation, I think it would cause difficulties of cohesion and coherence inside NATO and it might well cause escalation and confrontation in relation to Russia and if you also think what view Turkey might take on this, whether it would continue its NATO cooperation if a Europe which is visibly excluding Turkey were about to develop its union forces.
So there are a lot of different factors to take into account there. Were the US to follow through on what some people saw as the implicit logic of Donald Trump’s statements as a candidate, and were it actually to pull back from Europe, then I think the situation would change quite dramatically and one would see probably a course for a different security architecture. Anybody can look into their crystal ball, but I don’t think it is very likely.
So they are doing the right thing in pooling up some of the military capabilities to a soft defence union at the moment preparing in case of a horrible…
I think so. One of the things advocates for a full and proper defence union need to take into account is that internal politics in Europe are moving in all different kinds of directions and while there is a cause that is very clear perhaps in Brussels or the EU-part of Brussels rather than the Nato-part of Brussels for this much greater and closer coherence in defence and security matters amongst EU member states and within the EU institutions, that may look different in different national capitals.
Just as political integration and financial integration looks different in different national capitals. And I think that if Brexit gives one message, it ought to give a message to those that are the most enthusiastic about integration, which is that you cannot achieve this unless you take the whole constituency with you. And if you press it at the time when you don’t have the whole constituency with you, then you likely to lead to fragmentation.
But there are a lot of developments in Europe at the moment with the rise of the far right and populism, you think these are criteria for actually pulling a stronger union together. So you take over and can create a risk of a divided Europe and a fragmented Europe that loses its role in the world. And we know that single countries cannot compete strategically with China, India and the United States. There is a case for Europe to actually be stronger together, no?
Speaking personally, for a whole number of reasons other than defence, security, geostrategy and so on, I am completely in favour of a closer Europe. But that closer Europe must be a reality not simply in terms of what the policies and the alignments of governments are, and what can be agreed in horse-trading in late night sessions between the prime ministers or the foreign ministers. It must be a reality at the people’s level. People must see that there is a case for them, we must all understand that there are benefits, that life is better with this closer union than without it.
That is what the Remain-camp could not manage to persuade a majority of the British people. They nearly did, they got very close. But they didn’t achieve that. And if one looks at the EU institutions with the very cold eye, one can understand that. And very often when I talk with people from Brussels and from the EU institutions, I am horrified by their complacency and their narrow world in which they live, in which they don’t really know or sometimes even appear to care for what people in the south of Sweden or the eastern half of Hungary or rural Poland think about these issues.
And unless there is a real popular base for integration, it will not work, and pressing harder for integration would doubtless achieve some gains but it will also lead to some fragmentation. That said, I completely agree with you also that the rise of the far-right and populist forces is very, very worrying and we must work against that. But again, don’t think that can be done simply or primarily by coming to agreements that the EU should be integrated more. I think its the case for the democratic values that underpin the EU and the real consistent implementation of those democratic values, that what would work. All of this is personal, not as the director of SIPRI.
But that’s fair, obviously for an expert like you it is also important to have your own opinion. Now it’s five years since the EU got the Nobel Peace Prize and a lot of things have happened since then to dismantle this peace in Europe, do you see a risk of Europe becoming a ground for conflicts?
I think there is a paradox built into the Nobel Peace Prize for the EU. The EU, I think, has been since very early days of the early 1950s, before it was even a European Economic Community, its been a tremendous force for peace in Europe by existing, by being, not necessarily always by doing something for peace, but rather by doing something about democracy, about the economy, about peoples living conditions, about human rights values.
And I think when the Cold War ended, the enlargement of the EU had the same effect. It was areas which were, parts of Europe that were stable enough and had leaders with vision enough to want to adhere and be able to adhere to the EU although it took 13 or 14 years to achieve and finally get everything signed, ratified and implemented. That whole process helped consolidate peace in those areas and there was every chance that there would be more violence in Central and Eastern Europe than there was in the 1990s.
We were talking about it in peace and conflict research community 25 years ago, it was only in the end from Yugoslavia that really exploded and even there the EU was able to attract Slovenia, Croatia to the gains of EU-type peace. Where the EU has a more questionable or uncertain record is when its leaders are actually trying to do something about peace and when they try to use the soft power that the EU has.
So, if you look at EU leaders, they definitely got some decisons wrong in the lead-up to the violence in former Yugoslavia. I don’t think the EU is to be blamed as much as some of its critics say for what has happened in Crimea in Ukraine, but nonetheless, it plays a part and its eastern neighbourhood policy has not really managed to win the peace in the South Caucasus. So the paradox is that EU soft power is at its most effective when no politician tries to use it.
As soon as a politician tries to use it, they using financial or economic incentives and in parts of Europe that sounds like you are talking about bribery or you think you can win me with just a few trade concessions, I am a bigger player than that. And it actually outrages and irritates people as much as it incentivises them. So yes there is this paradox at the heart, which is that soft power is most effective when it is least used.
The EU has been a great peace project and since its founders and those who originally drove the idea forward were no longer alive when the Peace Prize Committee thought of giving the prize, they gave it to the institution at the time. It was fairly appropriate but doesn’t mean the EU is a great actor for peace anymore.
Let’s turn the question a bit differently.  Now there is an increasingly worried EU on the Western Balkans. Do you see them doing the right thing, are they using their soft power correctly?
In my theory, they shouldn’t use their soft power and that’s the way to make it effective.
So they shouldn’t be involved at all?
If you going to intervene in a situation as complex as the Western Balkans, you better really know what you are doing and what you are up to. And I think that we are back in a situation where actually the expertise on the Western Balkans in government establishments has drifted away a bit, because the situation has been peaceful so you put your experts onto other problems.
I mean, the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, there were very few people in the major foreign ministries who really understood what was happening in Yugoslavia. six or seven years later there was an army of them, but now those numbers again have depleted. So, no, I am very concerned in fact, that although I understand why it is impossible to be inactive, I am really concerned that they don’t have the knowledge and the insight or the credibility to be able to make this work. In the 1990s, the EU was on the upswing, it was enlarging, it was self-confident, the economies were growing, democracy was expanding, the Cold War was over, antagonists have disappeared, today that is not true.
And so the credibility of EU actions, promises and incentives in the case of Serbia for example, Serbs look southwards and they see that the EU was not really helpful towards Greeks, when Greece was hit by financial crisis and the problem is that that kind of tough attitude which the EU took together with the IMF towards Greece and its debt, making it continue to service that debt and keeping it going rather than just saying, we need a fresh economic start in Greece.
That kind of thing it comes back to haunt it. And the toughness and attitude, the lack of concern and the way which when Papandreou was prime minister he was kind of bullied by the EU, all of these things are affecting the credibility of the EU now in that part of the  world. And EU leaders and senior official may very well say in response to this: but they are two separate issues. Yes they are but if Serbian politicians and the public think they are the same issue, then they are the same issue.
If you had an expert to give one piece of advise to Federica Mogherini, what would that be?
Do your damnedest to persuade France and Britain while it is still a member as well as Germany that it is essential to engage in a dialogue with North Korea.

Is the equation going to be completely changed? I think it is not surprising then to hear things being said freely. I remember Angela Merkel last year talking about how Europe needs to get along without relying on some of its oldest and closest allies, and I think that is new. But what will play out in practice? I remain open-minded as to what is going to happen. I am not convinced that it will do, but we will see. At the moment, what are they thinking when they are talking about the defence union is pooling to get a lot of military capabilities but not really creating a real European army. Do you think Europe needs a European army? At the moment: No. If you were to look at this from a defence efficiency point of view, there are gains that Europe can make that are way short of a European army by further cooperation between different national units. At the moment, with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation there, that’s for good or real, that’s the security architecture Europe has and if a European army were injected into that equation, I think it would cause difficulties of cohesion and coherence inside NATO and it might well cause escalation and confrontation in relation to Russia and if you also think what view Turkey might take on this, whether it would continue its NATO cooperation if a Europe which is visibly excluding Turkey were about to develop its union forces. So there are a lot of different factors to take into account there. Were the US to follow through on what some people saw as the implicit logic of Donald Trump’s statements as a candidate, and were it actually to pull back from Europe, then I think the situation would change quite dramatically and one would see probably a course for a different security architecture. Anybody can look into their crystal ball, but I don’t think it is very likely. So they are doing the right thing in pooling up some of the military capabilities to a soft defence union at the moment preparing in case of a horrible… I think so. One of the things advocates for a full and proper defence union need to take into account is that internal politics in Europe are moving in all different kinds of directions and while there is a cause that is very clear perhaps in Brussels or the EU-part of Brussels rather than the Nato-part of Brussels for this much greater and closer coherence in defence and security matters amongst EU member states and within the EU institutions, that may look different in different national capitals. Just as political integration and financial integration looks different in different national capitals. And I think that if Brexit gives one message, it ought to give a message to those that are the most enthusiastic about integration, which is that you cannot achieve this unless you take the whole constituency with you. And if you press it at the time when you don’t have the whole constituency with you, then you likely to lead to fragmentation. But there are a lot of developments in Europe at the moment with the rise of the far right and populism, you think these are criteria for actually pulling a stronger union together. So you take over and can create a risk of a divided Europe and a fragmented Europe that loses its role in the world. And we know that single countries cannot compete strategically with China, India and the United States. There is a case for Europe to actually be stronger together, no? Speaking personally, for a whole number of reasons other than defence, security, geostrategy and so on, I am completely in favour of a closer Europe. But that closer Europe must be a reality not simply in terms of what the policies and the alignments of governments are, and what can be agreed in horse-trading in late night sessions between the prime ministers or the foreign ministers. It must be a reality at the people’s level. People must see that there is a case for them, we must all understand that there are benefits, that life is better with this closer union than without it. That is what the Remain-camp could not manage to persuade a majority of the British people. They nearly did, they got very close. But they didn’t achieve that. And if one looks at the EU institutions with the very cold eye, one can understand that. And very often when I talk with people from Brussels and from the EU institutions, I am horrified by their complacency and their narrow world in which they live, in which they don’t really know or sometimes even appear to care for what people in the south of Sweden or the eastern half of Hungary or rural Poland think about these issues. And unless there is a real popular base for integration, it will not work, and pressing harder for integration would doubtless achieve some gains but it will also lead to some fragmentation. That said, I completely agree with you also that the rise of the far-right and populist forces is very, very worrying and we must work against that. But again, don’t think that can be done simply or primarily by coming to agreements that the EU should be integrated more. I think its the case for the democratic values that underpin the EU and the real consistent implementation of those democratic values, that what would work. All of this is personal, not as the director of SIPRI. But that’s fair, obviously for an expert like you it is also important to have your own opinion. Now it’s five years since the EU got the Nobel Peace Prize and a lot of things have happened since then to dismantle this peace in Europe, do you see a risk of Europe becoming a ground for conflicts? I think there is a paradox built into the Nobel Peace Prize for the EU. The EU, I think, has been since very early days of the early 1950s, before it was even a European Economic Community, its been a tremendous force for peace in Europe by existing, by being, not necessarily always by doing something for peace, but rather by doing something about democracy, about the economy, about peoples living conditions, about human rights values. And I think when the Cold War ended, the enlargement of the EU had the same effect. It was areas which were, parts of Europe that were stable enough and had leaders with vision enough to want to adhere and be able to adhere to the EU although it took 13 or 14 years to achieve and finally get everything signed, ratified and implemented. That whole process helped consolidate peace in those areas and there was every chance that there would be more violence in Central and Eastern Europe than there was in the 1990s. We were talking about it in peace and conflict research community 25 years ago, it was only in the end from Yugoslavia that really exploded and even there the EU was able to attract Slovenia, Croatia to the gains of EU-type peace. Where the EU has a more questionable or uncertain record is when its leaders are actually trying to do something about peace and when they try to use the soft power that the EU has. So, if you look at EU leaders, they definitely got some decisons wrong in the lead-up to the violence in former Yugoslavia. I don’t think the EU is to be blamed as much as some of its critics say for what has happened in Crimea in Ukraine, but nonetheless, it plays a part and its eastern neighbourhood policy has not really managed to win the peace in the South Caucasus. So the paradox is that EU soft power is at its most effective when no politician tries to use it. As soon as a politician tries to use it, they using financial or economic incentives and in parts of Europe that sounds like you are talking about bribery or you think you can win me with just a few trade concessions, I am a bigger player than that. And it actually outrages and irritates people as much as it incentivises them. So yes there is this paradox at the heart, which is that soft power is most effective when it is least used. The EU has been a great peace project and since its founders and those who originally drove the idea forward were no longer alive when the Peace Prize Committee thought of giving the prize, they gave it to the institution at the time. It was fairly appropriate but doesn’t mean the EU is a great actor for peace anymore. Let’s turn the question a bit differently. Now there is an increasingly worried EU on the Western Balkans. Do you see them doing the right thing, are they using their soft power correctly? In my theory, they shouldn’t use their soft power and that’s the way to make it effective. So they shouldn’t be involved at all? If you going to intervene in a situation as complex as the Western Balkans, you better really know what you are doing and what you are up to. And I think that we are back in a situation where actually the expertise on the Western Balkans in government establishments has drifted away a bit, because the situation has been peaceful so you put your experts onto other problems. I mean, the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, there were very few people in the major foreign ministries who really understood what was happening in Yugoslavia. six or seven years later there was an army of them, but now those numbers again have depleted. So, no, I am very concerned in fact, that although I understand why it is impossible to be inactive, I am really concerned that they don’t have the knowledge and the insight or the credibility to be able to make this work. In the 1990s, the EU was on the upswing, it was enlarging, it was self-confident, the economies were growing, democracy was expanding, the Cold War was over, antagonists have disappeared, today that is not true. And so the credibility of EU actions, promises and incentives in the case of Serbia for example, Serbs look southwards and they see that the EU was not really helpful towards Greeks, when Greece was hit by financial crisis and the problem is that that kind of tough attitude which the EU took together with the IMF towards Greece and its debt, making it continue to service that debt and keeping it going rather than just saying, we need a fresh economic start in Greece. That kind of thing it comes back to haunt it. And the toughness and attitude, the lack of concern and the way which when Papandreou was prime minister he was kind of bullied by the EU, all of these things are affecting the credibility of the EU now in that part of the world. And EU leaders and senior official may very well say in response to this: but they are two separate issues. Yes they are but if Serbian politicians and the public think they are the same issue, then they are the same issue. If you had an expert to give one piece of advise to Federica Mogherini, what would that be? Do your damnedest to persuade France and Britain while it is still a member as well as Germany that it is essential to engage in a dialogue with North Korea.",29

                Turkish security forces yesterday (23 January) detained dozens more people nationwide on accusations of spreading propaganda for “terror” groups, in a major clampdown as Ankara presses its new offensive inside Syria.
Ninety-one people were detained in 13 provinces ranging from Izmir on the Aegean to Van in the east over their postings on social media.
Twenty-four people had been detained in other cities on Monday in raids that have raised new concerns among rights groups over freedom of expression in the country.
Among those taken into custody were five journalists, including writer and activist Nurcan Baysal, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said.

The detentions come as Turkey pressed ahead with its military incursion in northern Syria against the Syrian Kurdish People’s Protection Units (YPG) militia.



International concern grows over Turkey’s military incursion in Syria
Turkey yesterday (22 January) intensified its offensive against Kurdish militia targets in Syria as President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan vowed there would be no stepping back in a campaign that has stoked concern among Ankara’s allies and neighbours.


Ankara views the YPG as “terrorists” linked to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) waging a three-decade long insurgency in Turkey.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan called for national unity over the operation and warned those responding to calls for protests would pay a “heavy price”.
Erdoğan’s spokesman Ibrahim Kalin urged the “public, and especially the media, to be wary of lying, fake, distortive and provocative news, images and gossip”.
Kalin said in a statement that the authorities were watching the “disinformation activities closely” and would “quickly and resolutely” act within the framework of the law if necessary.
Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım added: “We are watching the provocations being spread on social media very closely.”
‘Making propaganda’ 
Twenty-three suspects were detained in the Aegean province of Izmir, the agency said. Six of the suspects had been planning a protest in a park, the agency said.
The Izmir provincial chairman of Turkey’s main pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) was reportedly also detained.
The authorities are responding to what they see as deliberate disinformation, including the use of images that some Turkish media said had been “manipulated” or simply taken from other conflicts but presented as from the current offensive.
Yıldırım hit out at those using images of children and civilians to blame Turkey for violence against innocent parties. “Social media is not unaccountable media,” he said.
Other arrests took place in the southeastern province of Diyarbakir, the capital Ankara, the southern city of Mersin and Mus and Van in the east.
Two reporters for the pro-Kurdish news agency Mezopotamya, Hayri Demir and Seda Taskin, were detained late Monday in Ankara, RSF said.

‘Intolerance of criticism’ 
The head of RSF’s Eastern Europe and Central Asia desk Johann Bihr said the “increase in the witchhunt against critics” and the lack of debate over the offensive highlighted “the degree to which pluralism has collapsed in Turkey”.
He added: “The government is now trying to assert complete control over everything that the media report, at the risk of undermining public trust and fuelling tension.”
After the arrests on Monday, Human Rights Watch (HRW) Turkey researcher Emma Sinclair-Webb hit out at Ankara’s “intolerance of criticism”.

Meanwhile, controversy rumbled over the vandalising by protesters of the offices of a newspaper in the Turkish Cypriot breakaway statelet — recognised only by Ankara — that had called the operation an “occupation”.
Hundreds had demonstrated outside the offices of the daily Afrika newspaper in Nicosia on Monday, apparently responding to a call by Erdoğan who had criticised the paper.
“Intimidating journalists is unacceptable. The European Parliament will always defend media freedom, the cornerstone of democracy,” wrote the President of the European Parliament Antonio Tajani on Twitter, as he condemned the attacks on the newspaper.

                The leader of the centre-right European People’s Party (EPP) Joseph Daul hailed the “window of opportunity” to resolve a long-standing name dispute between Greece and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), saying he hopes for concrete results.
Daul’s comment comes at a crucial moment of the negotiations and is contrary to that of the EPP’s Greek affiliate party, New Democracy, which claims that a solution to the name should be postponed.
“I hope that a mutually acceptable solution will be found and we welcome this window of opportunity that could lead to concrete results,” Daul told EURACTIV.com on Wednesday (24 January) in an exclusive statement.
The leaders of the two Balkan countries made further progress at a meeting in Davos on Wednesday, building on a rapprochement that started when Social Democrat Zoran Zaev took power in Macedonia last year and replaced the conservative nationalist predecessors.
But in Athens, the issue was not put to rest, as the main opposition New Democracy said the solution to the name dispute should be sought at another time, with proper preparation and not with the “secretive” agenda the leftist government has adopted.
The Greek government reacted strongly, saying that conservative leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis had bowed to political pressure from the “extreme-right” lawmakers of his party.
Renaming airport, motorway
FYROM Prime Minister Zaev held three hours of talks with his Greek counterpart Alexis Tsipras in Davos on 24 January and the two decided to take the talks a step forward.
Zaev said it was a moment to build good and prosperity relations in the entire region of the Balkans and stressed that his country wants to be a partner of Greece in the EU and NATO.
All UN member states currently recognise FYROM as a sovereign state but remain divided over what to call it, Macedonia (its official constitutional name, opposed by Greece) or FYROM. The EU is also divided over the issue and the name dispute has been mediated by the United Nations.
Due to the name dispute, Athens has blocked FYROM’s attempts to join both the EU and NATO.
Athens argues that the name Macedonia suggests that Skopje has territorial claims to the northernmost Greek region of the same name, of which Thessaloniki is the capital.
According to press reports in Skopje, UN special envoy on the name dispute, Matthew Nimetz, will visit the two countries at the end of the month to further discuss the proposals he presented during a meeting in the US on 17 January.



Athens and Skopje move closer to resolving eternal name row
Greece and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) are moving closer to resolving a 25-year-old name dispute, which should pave the way for Skopje to join NATO this year and possibly remove a major obstacle for its EU integration.


In a signal of “strong commitment” to finding a solution, Zaev noted that he would rename Skopje’s Alexander the Great airport – the new name is not known yet – as well as the north-south ‘Alexander the Great’ motorway ending at the Greek border, which will be renamed “Friendship Highway”.
Both names came from the previous nationalist government’s drive to revamp the country’s image.
“Our action shows that we have no irredentist aspirations and we hope to be a step towards the solution,” Zaev said.
Tsipras reiterated that his country did not only want to resolve the name dispute but simultaneously put relations between the two countries on solid foundations of mutual respect and good neighbourliness.
“This means that we must first deal with irredentism in all its forms as well as have guarantees that we will not leave any open window to re-create similar challenges in the future,” the Greek leader added.



Tensions grow before biggest secret is revealed: FYROM's new name
The opposition VMRO-DPMNE of former Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski in Skopje, possibly encouraged by Russia, is trying to hinder the resolution of a name dispute with Greece that has blocked the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia’s (FYROM) progress in joining NATO and the European Union.


‘An injury to the nation’s soul’
However, New Democracy does not share the optimism of the government and its European political family.
Speaking to his lawmakers yesterday, party leader Mitsotakis said that the solution to the name dispute should be sought at another time.
“For us, the issue closes here. We will not take part in any way in the dangerous games that the government is going to play, nor do we get involved in tactics. It is a matter for those who have opened up [this issue]. We will not become accomplices in a story that risks injuring the soul of the nation,” Mitsotakis warned.
“I will not accept the rupture in [Greek] Macedonia’s ties with the rest of Greece.”
Mitsotakis went further, accusing Tsipras of negotiating in secret without informing the opposition parties and the Greek people.
If I were in Tsipras’ position, he said, I would start negotiating first on irredentism issues and would expect tangible results before proceeding.
“I would not negotiate anything unless Skopje committed to change their constitution. I would not tolerate any reference to a ‘Macedonian nation’ as Mr Nimetz did, with no reply from the government.”
As for the protests that took place last week in Thessaloniki, Mitsotakis said the government was “stunned” by the massive turnout and was trying to slander those who took part.



Tens of thousands join Greek protest over Macedonia name row
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets of northern Greece’s biggest city Thessaloniki on Sunday (21 January), police said, in a long-running row between Athens and Skopje over the use of the name Macedonia.


“The majority, however, did not consist of extremists and it is a shame to describe them as such,” he emphasised.
Mitsotakis had said that it was a personal decision of each member of his party to participate or not in the protest. Some members of the party, mainly those who are elected in Northern Greece, indeed took part.



EPP hails positive momentum on Macedonia name dispute
The centre-right European People’s Party (EPP) is satisfied with the new rapprochement between Skopje and Athens, as the two sides aim to unlock Macedonia’s NATO bid and open the door to EU accession talks. But some within the party counselled caution.


The ruling Syriza party reacted strongly, saying that Mitsotakis’ statements show his slide towards the extreme-right.
“The supposedly liberal Mr Mitsotakis proved once again that he has handed the keys of the party to the extreme-right faction that exists within it,” the party said in a statement and added there were members of New Democracy who do not want the term ‘Macedonia’ to be in the new name.
Pro-government newspapers in Athens commented that Mitsotakis is being held hostage to the right-wing faction of his party.
“Mitsotakis is serving his internal political interests; he does not hesitate to sacrifice the efforts to solve a national issue in order not to divide the various fiefdoms within his party,” the government noted.

                Education is the best way to confront fake news but regulation also plays a part and freedom of speech should not take precedence over the need to remove inflammatory content and hate speech, former European Commissioner Neelie Kroes told EURACTIV.com.
In two successive mandates, Neelie Kroes was the competition commissioner and then the vice-president in charge of the digital agenda. She spoke to EURACTIV’s Editor-in-Chief Daniela Vincenti in Davos. 
If you were a Commissioner today, how do you think you would tackle the problem of fake news ahead of the European elections?
Wow, I couldn’t think of a more difficult question. For me, it all started with the attitude of readers and listeners, if they are educated, then they can act as their own judge on what they see and hear and won’t accept, in principle, that what is written is true, however that’s not the case. So I believe in education focusing on emphasising critical listening and critical debating, as well as listening to debates, for me that is key.
Fake news will stay, and I’m not optimistic about it, it is not interesting if I am against it, but I am against it of course, but it won’t fade away. There will always be temptations for not only politicians by the way, but also for others with disruptive thoughts and feelings to create such content. Therefore everyone’s critical attitude is at stake and we are still not at the stage where we can be confident that we are doing what is right for the future generation who are still pure.
So what you are suggesting is starting education from an early age to make them critical readers instead of regulating fake news?
Regulation is in a way to an end, but don’t overestimate regulation. As regulation in most cases is based on the past and there will be new possibilities to present fake news in the future. It is important for me that we are more alert on just teaching people to listen and discuss in arguments.
In my personal opinion, of course, the outcome of the elections in the US is an example of a lack of awareness,  if you were to look at a map of where Trump got most of his support from, most of it are people living with one-liners. For me, that is the bad part of social media, it is about one-liners quite often and if you haven’t learned at school, and those people mostly are undereducated when you compare it with the European average, those people are believing one-liners. So we have to start with education, start with teaching people not to accept everything.
So if we need to start educating the next generation now, but in the case of the current generation, is there something that social media companies or media companies could do to make sure that they can revert or “drown” this trend?
Well, they, but also the political world, has the obligation and has the duty to just cut off all that news with awful messages, for children and others… There you can see that not only the big ones are taking their measures, but also the smaller ones are taking their measures and not allowing that type of message.
Nowadays, we are confronted with a dilemma, no doubt about that, as these things can be written and read by whoever, and it could contain the most horrible message, and because of social media and how it works we should be aware that there are limits, and the limitation of freedom of speech, and I’m a liberal so it is hard for me to say, but there are limitations for freedom of speech, especially if it is so much against a democracy.
But who should apply those limitations?
Well, the government has a role, no doubt about that… I also think that corporates that are confronted with this type of issues are absolutely responsible too. For example, I remember years and years ago BT taking duty on the awful messages about child pornography, saying that even if it is against freedom of speech that it would not be allowed on their network,  and I think that’s correct in my opinion.
So governments have to play a role. Politicians, by the way, should be aware that they have a responsibility, not of finding where the limits are but finding where the opportunities are for creating more responsibility, that is responsible.
Now the Commission has launched a High-Level Group on Fake News. If you had to give advice to Mariya Gabriel, who is very young and prone to do well, as a seasoned politician and a liberal what would you tell her?
Don’t give up, as it is a very difficult task but it is stimulating a debate, and I think that even if the final results won’t be as expected, don’t give up. And I strongly believe in more discussion about this issue for people. Also, I believe that most people in Europe, but also in other parts of the world, are not in the mood to accept everything and they are fed up with seeming like a fool and not having the opportunity to say ”that’s fake news, stop it”. So I wish her a lot of wisdom and it is again a push for a debate.

                Europe is back – its economy is growing and political stability is improving, Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaitė told EURACTIV.com. But Europe now needs to work to preserve its set of shared values and resolve the major challenges of migration and security, she warned.
Dalia Grybauskaitė has been president of Lithuania since 2009.
She spoke to EURACTIV Editor-in-Chief Daniela Vincenti on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos.
President Macron and Chancellor Merkel both gave a very upbeat speech on Europe yesterday. Europe is back, France is back. How do you see the end of the mandate of the current Commission up to the European elections? 
It is good that we have gone through some sensitive elections in Europe and we got at least two leaders back which are very much pro-European. We also have a better economic outlook and a more stable economic situation in Europe. That means that we could be, and we are more optimistic on how Europe will look like in the future. That means we do have more time to discuss the future of Europe’s deep integration and what we can do together.
Of course, we do have different opinions, and we have some groupings of countries which would like to slow down the speed of integration, that’s normal. We do also have some sensitivities with the Brexit environment, but comparatively with last year, we have been more confident this year because we see solutions. Solutions are coming on Brexit, Europe’s economy is growing quite fast, political stability is starting to take place in Europe and after the final negotiations in Germany, we will have two large countries acting as locomotives for deep integration in Europe. This gives us confidence that we will be able to go ahead with our future.
But there is a big confrontational issue at the moment which is migration, where there is no way of finding a common ground. What would it take to find a common ground according to you?
I would not say it is confrontational, it is very problematic around the world. It is a global problem, not only a European problem and how best to solve it is a question for everybody, not only Europeans. We see that the philosophy to take in and to try to integrate didn’t work out, the quota system worked only partially and worked better in some countries than others. That means we need to come up with more creative solutions, but these need to be global solutions and they need to be agreed on a global scale because Europe only cannot absorb every refugee.
You are aware of the saying that you need to put your house in order before looking at the bigger picture, and putting the house in order is turning, as Tsipras and Gentiloni were saying yesterday, it is turning the illegal migration into legal migration. So creating a framework at the European level where there will be a better way of absorbing migrants on a legal basis. What do you think of these remarks?
As I said, integrational absorption and integration later as a second step of refugees is a very difficult problem because they are not easily integrating into our societies, in some societies even not integrating at all, and running out to different countries. That is a problem of the quota system.  We need to look for solutions which will benefit both sides, us as European countries who are taking in, and the refugees who are coming in, because you cannot force them to stay in one country against their will. So that means that it is very difficult. We need to find solutions, no matter, some will be legal, some will be communal, some national additions too, but also investments into the third countries closer to the source of the problem.
Let’s turn to another big topic: upholding European values. Both Merkel and Macron gave a very emotional speech about upholding European values, and we have some countries in Europe that are not upholding these values, I could mention Poland and Hungary. How do you make sure that you don’t lose those values?
The European Union was created on values, it is not only an economic support organisation. It was created mainly and firstly on values such as freedom, exchange of education, free movement of labour, a joint economic area, democracy, and rule of law amongst others. All of this as a package is important – you cannot just pick or fulfil one value and throw out another one. For us in the Baltic States, particularly in Lithuania, Europe is about values first, and then economic benefit second.
The problem is that in some countries as a general trend around the world nationalism is regaining popularity, in most countries, even large ones, we see political parties gaining rule and then isolating themselves to make a priority of so-called national interest. This is a tendency that we need to fight against, but not with forceful measures, we need to persuade each other, we need to talk again amongst each other. That is how decisions are made in Europe, we need to talk and have a consensus.
Is there a window of opportunity to convince them?
We have no choice, Europe is about talking, convincing, and making solutions. But not beating each other or forcing each other, that is not an instrument that Europe can use.
Are you afraid of the European elections in regards to the rise of populist parties?
No, in all countries elections are not easy and populist parties are taking over, so again what we need to do is persuade our own people, as elections are national really and not European, so we need to do our homework at home.
On security in the Baltic states. Tomorrow you are participating in a panel on Central and Eastern Europe. With a Defence Union, do you feel that as a Baltic state you have the right tool to feel more secure?
We feel it not as a Baltic state, we feel it as a NATO territory. Whatever it takes NATO territories on the east are protected by article 5. Also, the EU  will of course invest more into defence, joint policies, cybersecurity and all other new hybrid threats. But in general, we are a territory of NATO, not just separate Baltic states, or other, because the threats are global. Starting from the Arctic up to the very south such as Portugal, threats from a defence point of view are more or less the same.
This is why we will be investing a lot into the NATO summit this summer to go ahead with additional deterrence measures and defence measures in our region. Along with the new policies in Europe which are taken by the deep integration in defence and research in the defence industry, in cybersecurity. We are actively participating in these good tendencies. It is a very good position for Europe to add to what NATO can do to secure the defence.
Will we become a hard power?
Not yet, but maybe in the future, it depends on what definition hard power will have in the future because very soon cybersecurity will probably become a hard element as it becomes more and more important. Additionally, unconventional threats are more important powerful and influential nowadays, so that probably, eventually, we will also call them hard defence instruments.
So Europe is back? 
That’s the best message for this year.

                The roots of Euroscepticism among the Czechs go back 10 or 15 years and if Jiří Drahoš defeats the incumbent President Miloš Zeman in a runoff vote on 26-27 January, he will struggle to reverse the trend, political analyst Lubomír Kopeček told EURACTIV.
Lubomír Kopeček is a professor of political sciences at the Faculty of Social Studies in Brno, Czech Republic. Last summer he published a book on the political career of the current Czech President Miloš Zeman. 
Kopeček spoke to EURACTIV Slovakia’s Marián Koreň. 
Five years of Miloš Zeman´s mandate as president was characterized by a friendly relationship with China and Russia… 
In 2013 Miloš Zeman was considered as an accepted politician in the West. At that time he had quite a good reputation. However, we saw a shift in 2014. The number of the business trips heading to the West has dramatically decreased in favour of business trips to the East. Since that time, Zeman has not been very welcome in certain Western countries. It is probably most obvious in the attitude of the United States. He has not deserved any relevant reception from the American administration in 5 years.
When Zeman took office in 2013, he hoisted the EU flag at Prague Castle. Nowadays, he supports a referendum on whether to exit from the EU, but says he himself would vote against the exit. What is his real attitude towards the EU?
The book I wrote about him is called ‘The Story of a Talented Pragmatist’. It also reflects his attitude towards the EU, which is most obvious when looking into the past: he brought the Czech Republic into the EU, he used to keep very close relations with social democrats from Western Europe and so on. He used to show support to the deepening of European integration and he used to call himself as Eurofederalist.
On the other hand, as the orientation towards the East and the issues such as refugees or referendum on withdrawal from the EU were becoming more important to him, the more his interest in the EU was weakening.
Nowadays, he is known as one of the most eurosceptic people in the Czech Republic. A huge paradox is hidden inside because even nowadays he sometimes says he is a Eurofederalist. Zeman is a dual person who did not completely give up his previous attitudes but is covering them up with something much more visible.
Where can we find the roots of the Czech Euroscepticism?
The attitude of the elites is essential, but I am not talking only about the attitude of Miloš Zeman. Since 2006, the emphasis on European issues has been weakening even in case of the political parties which used to be pro-European. I do not mean to say they are no longer pro-European, but they stopped working on the topic. At that moment, Social or Christian Democrats stopped taking it as their priority.
The second thing is that the internal topics are getting a European label. It means shifting the blame for unpopular things on the European Union. On the other hand, certain absurd issues, which are coming from the EU and can be easily misused in the political debate, help nourish the Euroscepticism.
It is also important to mention the influence of the economic recession which in 2008 – a little bit paradoxically – turned against the positive perception of the EU. In the Czech Republic, the bad mood was reflected in the scepticism towards the EU.
You mentioned the attitude of the elites. It is often said that Czech Euroscepticism is very much influenced by the former and current Czech Presidents. Václav Klaus sowed the seeds and Miloš Zeman is continuing it. Could Jiří Drahoš reverse this trend if he becomes the new president of the Czech Republic?
Not to reverse but moderate it. In the sense that we will not have a head of state with such eurosceptic positions as we did during the mandate of the two previous presidents. Nevertheless, it is necessary to be careful – the head of the state is influential but he or she is not almighty and cannot completely reverse the moods in society. Jiří Drahoš is nowadays representing the part of the society that is neutral or slightly positive towards the EU. But he would not be able to reverse something which has been forming here for ten or fifteen years along.
How important as a topic is the EU in the presidential elections? 
The Union is usually perceived not as a separate big issue but related to something else. When Zeman is emphasising the issue of the referendum and direct democracy, he is linking it with the withdrawal from the EU. Similarly, refugees and the EU are joint vessels – the EU dictated migration quotas to the Czech Republic.
In foreign media, we can read that the Czech president will play a substantial role in the democratic direction of the country after the parliamentary elections. Is this just a journalistic paraphrase or a realistic option?
The power pact between Zeman and Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (who resigned after his government lost a confidence vote in mid-January) is not being formed these days, it has been existing in the Czech Republic for a couple of years. The reason for this pact is the fact that they are very helpful to one another.
But does it have a long-term perspective?
It is questionable. If the government of the ANO movement – with or without Babiš – gets the confidence vote and Miloš Zeman wins another mandate, the objective of the pact will run out, they will not need one another so much anymore.
At the same time, the effort to find common ground on more substantial issues, for instance, the attitude towards the European Union, can disappear. The EU is a completely natural space for Andrej Babiš. His behaviour clearly says that he does not want to be in the same position of an unwanted person as Jarosław Kaczyński. He wants to be accepted in Europe.
Moreover, the pro-Eastern orientation of the Czech Republic is not a priority for Babiš. In his government programme declaration, there is just one sentence related to China. The declaration says that cooperation with China makes sense only in case it brings advantages to both sides. It is too little.
If they are both in positions enabling them to influence Czech politics, it is quite probable this will be a point of conflict. Though, Zeman had already been in conflict with the previous government because of certain topics. In other words, it would be nothing new.
What would the victory of Jiří Drahoš mean for the ambitions of Andrej Babiš to be the prime minister?
In the short term – nothing, because the current president will still be in office for the next six weeks, even if he does not win. This gives him large space to nominate Andrej Babiš as prime minister for the second time. That is why I do not think Jiří Drahoš will have a chance to influence the nomination of the next prime minister.
He might have an indirect influence. If President Zeman does not win the presidential elections, political players will have to start acting very quickly. There might be a chance for Drahoš to influence the political situation, if the setting up of a new government was dragging on. This could happen only in the summer 2018, but it is extremely unlikely that we would not have a new government by that time.
So are you convinced that in case of failure, Miloš Zeman will not miss the opportunity to nominate the Prime Minister for the second time?
I doubt he would not take this opportunity. It would be strange if he threw out the possibility to influence the future form of the government and let his opponent decide.

Since 2006, the emphasis on European issues has been weakening even in case of the political parties which used to be pro-European. I do not mean to say they are no longer pro-European, but they stopped working on the topic. At that moment, Social or Christian Democrats stopped taking it as their priority. The second thing is that the internal topics are getting a European label. It means shifting the blame for unpopular things on the European Union. On the other hand, certain absurd issues, which are coming from the EU and can be easily misused in the political debate, help nourish the Euroscepticism. It is also important to mention the influence of the economic recession which in 2008 – a little bit paradoxically – turned against the positive perception of the EU. In the Czech Republic, the bad mood was reflected in the scepticism towards the EU. You mentioned the attitude of the elites. It is often said that Czech Euroscepticism is very much influenced by the former and current Czech Presidents. Václav Klaus sowed the seeds and Miloš Zeman is continuing it. Could Jiří Drahoš reverse this trend if he becomes the new president of the Czech Republic? Not to reverse but moderate it. In the sense that we will not have a head of state with such eurosceptic positions as we did during the mandate of the two previous presidents. Nevertheless, it is necessary to be careful – the head of the state is influential but he or she is not almighty and cannot completely reverse the moods in society. Jiří Drahoš is nowadays representing the part of the society that is neutral or slightly positive towards the EU. But he would not be able to reverse something which has been forming here for ten or fifteen years along. How important as a topic is the EU in the presidential elections? The Union is usually perceived not as a separate big issue but related to something else. When Zeman is emphasising the issue of the referendum and direct democracy, he is linking it with the withdrawal from the EU. Similarly, refugees and the EU are joint vessels – the EU dictated migration quotas to the Czech Republic. In foreign media, we can read that the Czech president will play a substantial role in the democratic direction of the country after the parliamentary elections. Is this just a journalistic paraphrase or a realistic option? The power pact between Zeman and Prime Minister Andrej Babiš (who resigned after his government lost a confidence vote in mid-January) is not being formed these days, it has been existing in the Czech Republic for a couple of years. The reason for this pact is the fact that they are very helpful to one another. But does it have a long-term perspective? It is questionable. If the government of the ANO movement – with or without Babiš – gets the confidence vote and Miloš Zeman wins another mandate, the objective of the pact will run out, they will not need one another so much anymore. At the same time, the effort to find common ground on more substantial issues, for instance, the attitude towards the European Union, can disappear. The EU is a completely natural space for Andrej Babiš. His behaviour clearly says that he does not want to be in the same position of an unwanted person as Jarosław Kaczyński. He wants to be accepted in Europe. Moreover, the pro-Eastern orientation of the Czech Republic is not a priority for Babiš. In his government programme declaration, there is just one sentence related to China. The declaration says that cooperation with China makes sense only in case it brings advantages to both sides. It is too little. If they are both in positions enabling them to influence Czech politics, it is quite probable this will be a point of conflict. Though, Zeman had already been in conflict with the previous government because of certain topics. In other words, it would be nothing new. What would the victory of Jiří Drahoš mean for the ambitions of Andrej Babiš to be the prime minister? In the short term – nothing, because the current president will still be in office for the next six weeks, even if he does not win. This gives him large space to nominate Andrej Babiš as prime minister for the second time. That is why I do not think Jiří Drahoš will have a chance to influence the nomination of the next prime minister. He might have an indirect influence. If President Zeman does not win the presidential elections, political players will have to start acting very quickly. There might be a chance for Drahoš to influence the political situation, if the setting up of a new government was dragging on. This could happen only in the summer 2018, but it is extremely unlikely that we would not have a new government by that time. So are you convinced that in case of failure, Miloš Zeman will not miss the opportunity to nominate the Prime Minister for the second time? I doubt he would not take this opportunity. It would be strange if he threw out the possibility to influence the future form of the government and let his opponent decide.",34

                Europe is back, the world’s business and political elites heard in Davos this week. But, as Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa rightly cautioned, there is no room for complacency.
Indeed, the elephant in the room is plain to see even though few EU officials have publicly said as much: since the big bang of enlargement in 2004, most new ex-communist members have done nothing to strengthen their democracy and rule of law.
Quite the contrary: while the prospect of EU membership provided enough of a carrot to make candidates implement reforms, fight corruption and keep nationalism and xenophobia at bay, the standards have since slipped and the sticks at hand are weak.
The growing east-west gap – particularly visible on migration, but also on basic democratic principles – only reinforces the image of a two-speed Europe.
Poland and Hungary, the ‘rogue’ states that have openly defied Brussels and got away with it – for now – are only the most visible examples.
A new report commissioned by the Greens/EFA group in the European Parliament shows that anti-corruption efforts in Bulgaria – the country that currently holds the EU presidency – leave a lot to be desired.
Bulgaria is the worst-performing country in the European Union in the fight against corruption, according to the ranking of Transparency International, and ranks 109th globally in the World Press Freedom Index from Reporters without Borders. In 2006, before joining the EU, it ranked 36th.
“Despite some progress, corruption remains a major concern in Bulgaria and needs to be tackled urgently,” said MEP Sven Giegold, who was rapporteur for the European Parliament’s report on transparency, accountability and integrity in the EU institutions.
Earlier this week, the Commission – Juncker and Timmermans, no less – issued a stark warning to Romania over concerns about the judiciary and corruption in the country as it prepares to take over the EU presidency next January.
“We are following the latest developments in Romania with concern,” the two said in a statement.
A package of legislative changes that opponents say will curb the powers of Romanian anti-corruption investigators has triggered mass protests. The most recent was on Saturday, when 30,000 demonstrators took to the streets in Bucharest.
“The Commission calls on the Romanian parliament to rethink the course of action proposed… The Commission again warns against backtracking,” said Juncker and Timmermans.
Add to that continuing government instability – with the third prime minister in a year installed this month – and it is clear that Romania, just like Bulgaria, will be kept outside the Schengen area for some time.
The eurozone also remains a distant prospect for both, though Bulgaria said earlier in January it would apply this year to be allowed into the ERM-2, the euro waiting room, in which every candidate spends at least two years.
Enter Croatia, the latest EU member, which only joined in 2013. Its economy reversed almost a decade of decline in 2015 and has been growing ever since, but its democratic credentials have taken a turn for the worse.
Governed by a coalition led by the conservative HDZ party since early 2016, the country has seen something of a return to the nationalist rhetoric of the 1990s (the period of its struggle for independence from Yugoslavia), a revival of its Nazi-era history in the public domain and gradual cuts in funding for independent media and NGOs.
That’s why it was visited twice in as many years by a team of media freedom experts, who said upon returning to Brussels last week that there have been some improvements, but serious concerns remain.
The EU has rightly identified the need for unity as a priority. But how will it strengthen the ‘shared set of core values’ that simply isn’t there?
This edition of Trans-Europe Express is co-financed by the European Parliament.
The Inside Track
Stop the presses. Croatia has fallen to 74th place in the World Press Freedom Index, just below Mongolia, Malawi and Hungary. Reporters Without Borders warned urgent action is needed to stop the rot.
Europe here we come? Support for EU membership is growing in Serbia, with a recent poll finding that just over half of people would now vote to join the bloc. Jobs and free movement are the biggest draws.
Cough up the cash. The mayor of the Turkish city of Gaziantep told EURACTIV the EU “doesn’t understand Turkey” and has not paid enough for its part in the refugee deal.
Must try harder. Bulgaria’s environment minister was given a rough ride by MEPs over his denial of climate change and his decision to approve a new ski lift in a protected national park.
Violence against women. Bulgaria’s United Patriots are refusing to ratify the Istanbul Convention on preventing violence against women and domestic violence for fear of legitimising the “third sex”.
Euronews in the doghouse. Ukraine’s ambassador to the EU sent an outraged letter to the Commission about a “positive” feature the news network aired on the occupying Russian army in Crimea.
Nationalism’s no longer a taboo. The FPÖ may be in government for the first time in Austria, but the far-right party has always been influential behind the scenes.
Corruption backsliding. Protesters hit the streets of Romania again this week over the government’s latest attempt to bury the fight against corruption. The EU is “Concerned”.
Deeply rooted scepticism. A change of leadership in the Czech Republic will not make the county’s people less Eurosceptic, political analyst Lubomir Kopecek told EURACTIV Slovakia.

                The EU is like a cabbage, it has many layers. An important one is the political families, like the EPP, the European Peoples’ Party, PES, the Party of European Socialists, or ALDE, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats in Europe.
Historically, the EPP and ALDE were born first, in 1976. EPP has been the largest in the European Parliament since 1999. PES was established much later, in 1992. Today the heads of state and governments of these countries hold meetings ahead of EU summits and devise strategies to shape policies and obtain top international jobs.
The political families also try to help members win national elections.
It’s interesting to note that political forces from all European countries can be members of the European political families. This includes the EU hopefuls Macedonia, Serbia, Kosovo, Albania, Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina. EPP and PES takes sister parties from these countries as associate members.
The EPP and ALDE also take on board sister parties from the Eastern Partnership, and ALDE has taken on board even two Russian parties (Yabloko and Parnass).
For a political force in a country like Macedonia, to be part of a European political family is a great credential. But this is precisely when things often go wrong.
For years it has been known that the political force of Nikola Gruevski, VMRO-DPMNE, affiliated to the EPP, has little to do with European values. Leaked wiretaps have exposed Gruevski as prime minister talking about arranging court cases, placing judges in senior positions, and much more.
The EPP, however, stood firm in support of Gruevski, which did little service to the country. The EPP keeps in its ranks political forces such as Viktor Orban’s Fidesz, although EPP members of the European Parliament are divided over the issue. Joseph Daul, the president of the EPP, said about Orbán: “He’s the enfant terrible of the EPP family, but I like him”.
These are some of the (many) bad examples. There are also good examples. Frans Timmermans, the most senior socialist in the Juncker Commission, has twice in less than a year issued stern warnings against the social-democrat government in Romania. There are, of course, good reasons for that.
Another great positive example is the position recently expressed by Joseph Daul with respect to the rare chance to resolve the Macedonian name dispute. If the dispute is solved, Macedonia or ‘the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia’ [we have no problem with either name] could at last join NATO and start accession talks to join the EU, under its new pro-European government.
Daul hailed the “window of opportunity” to resolve the name dispute, much to the distaste of New Democracy, the EPP sister party in Greece, whose leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis says exactly the opposite, probably because he is the hostage of a destructive extreme-right.
If the tendency of political families to be more careful about their hygiene is confirmed, who knows? Maybe they will be more successful at the next European elections.
The Roundup
The EU is warming to the idea of a flexible Brexit transition period. This would include allowing Britain to sign trade deals and launching new partnerships before any formal transition period is up. But airlines are afraid they will lose out if Britain quits the European Aviation Safety Agency.
Keen to signal the end of ten years of crises, EU leaders showed cautious optimism at the World Economic Forum. But they stressed there is no room for complacency.

Turkey has called on the EU to back its anti-Kurdish military campaign in Syria, saying it is protecting the security of Europe.
France intends to ban controversial weed killer glyphosate within three years, but will exempt farmers who can demonstrate that they have no other choice.
It’s Friday! That means it’s time for Tweets of the Week. This week, Davos leaders drink wine and whine, Qualcomm hit with a massive fine, and Romanian rule of law is in serious decline.

                Russian police wrestled opposition leader Alexei Navalny into a patrol wagon on Sunday (28 January) moments after he appeared at a rally to urge voters to boycott what he said would be a rigged presidential election in March.
Navalny has little chance of influencing the election, likely to be won comfortably by President Vladimir Putin, but his ability to use social media to mobilize crowds of mostly young protesters in major cities has irked the Kremlin.
The numbers attending Sunday’s protests across Russia — some shouting “Putin is a thief” — appeared lower than previous demonstrations staged by Navalny, Reuters reporters said, suggesting momentum may have shifted away from him.

Video footage posted on social media showed Navalny appear on Moscow’s main thoroughfare, Tverskaya Street, a few hundred meters from the Kremlin, to join several hundred supporters taking part in the protest, which the authorities had said was illegal.
He had only walked a short distance when he was surrounded by police officers wearing helmets. They grabbed him and forced him to the ground on the pavement, and then dragged him feet first into the patrol wagon, the video footage showed.

He was held at a police precinct in central Moscow for several hours before being released without charges, his lawyer Olga Mikhailova told Reuters, adding that Navalny would face court at a later date.
If charged with violating laws on holding demonstrations, Navalny could face up to 30 days in prison.
Protest numbers
Navalny emerged as a threat to the Kremlin’s tight grip on power on 12 June last year, when thousands of his followers defied police prohibitions to protest in cities across Russia.



Nearly 1,000 held as Navalny supporters protest across Russia
Authorities detained Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny and more than 1,000 of his supporters yesterday (12 June), as they mounted demonstrations across the nation against government corruption, coinciding with the National day.


On Sunday, around 1,500 protesters converged at Manezh Square, adjacent to the Kremlin, but were blocked from getting any further by metal barriers and dozens of police in riot gear.
Hundreds of people also protested in St. Petersburg, Russia’s second-biggest city, in Yekaterinburg in the Ural mountains, and other major centers.
By 1830 Moscow time (1530 GMT), police had detained 257 protesters nationwide, according to OVD-Info, a non-governmental group that tracks the arrests.
Navalny, who says he has faced a campaign of harassment from the authorities, has struggled to mobilize the same numbers in the two nationwide protests he has called since the breakthrough protest in June.
In Moscow on Sunday, the protesters who had accompanied Navalny until his detention were at times hard to distinguish from the flow of shoppers and sight-seers on Tverskaya Street.
A Reuters reporter heard two American tourists asking if Putin “is coming to this parade?” A few meters from where Navalny was detained, a tour guide was telling a group of clients about the history of a pre-revolutionary mansion.
Dominant leader 
Putin, 65, has been in power, either as president or prime minister, since 2000, longer than veteran Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev and outstripped only by dictator Josef Stalin.
Many voters credit him with restoring stability after the turbulence following the collapse of the Soviet Union, and of rebuilding Russia’s influence abroad through his foreign policy.
Putin has said the presidential election will be fair, and that Navalny, lacking real popular support, is irresponsibly trying to foment social anger which could tip Russia back into instability.
Putin’s opponents say he is maintaining his grip on power by eroding democracy.

About 200 protesters gathered in Vladivostok, on Russia’s Pacific coast, alleging that the election would be skewed in Putin’s favor.
“We have not been given any choice,” said local resident Vladimir Redko, who turned up to the protest carrying a small child in his arms.
“And as a citizen of the Russian Federation, I feel it is my civic duty to declare my position, to say I disagree.”

Dominant leader Putin, 65, has been in power, either as president or prime minister, since 2000, longer than veteran Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev and outstripped only by dictator Josef Stalin. Many voters credit him with restoring stability after the turbulence following the collapse of the Soviet Union, and of rebuilding Russia’s influence abroad through his foreign policy. Putin has said the presidential election will be fair, and that Navalny, lacking real popular support, is irresponsibly trying to foment social anger which could tip Russia back into instability. Putin’s opponents say he is maintaining his grip on power by eroding democracy. It’s a complete myth that Putin is popular if this is what he has to do with a real popular politician Alexey Navalny, when Navalny protests the fake elections that Putin is staging for March https://t.co/A3oXub1Agw — Bill Browder (@Billbrowder) January 28, 2018 About 200 protesters gathered in Vladivostok, on Russia’s Pacific coast, alleging that the election would be skewed in Putin’s favor. “We have not been given any choice,” said local resident Vladimir Redko, who turned up to the protest carrying a small child in his arms. “And as a citizen of the Russian Federation, I feel it is my civic duty to declare my position, to say I disagree.”",37

                Conflicts, poverty and drought have forced hundreds of thousands of Africans to leave their homes. Czechs are among the Europeans who go there to give them a helping hand, which can take the form of seed potatoes, textbooks or even simple advice on how to nurture their children appropriately.
The article was originally published on 14 January at Aktuálně.cz, EURACTIV.cz’s media partner. 
There are more than 218 million people living in extreme poverty in Africa. The European Union therefore invests millions of euros to improve the living conditions of Africans and to limit their mass migration to the north.
The financial assistance provided to Africa by the EU then turns into real and concrete aid – for example, in the form of sweet potato seedlings, wells or school buildings.
This transformation of European funds is based on hours of paperwork, difficult field trips and negotiations with African communities.
Jana Toužimská from the People in Need organisation, a Czech NGO which runs projects for example in Ethiopia, has some experience with it. Thanks to one of these projects, local communities learn to cultivate potato varieties rich in vitamin A, which prevents children’s dwarfism.
“We have test fields where we teach locals to grow potatoes,” says Toužimská.
Ethiopian workers from different organizations, who know the environment best, are involved in working with local communities. In addition to the cultivation itself, they explore what plant varieties are capable of withstanding the harsh conditions in Ethiopia.
Local people learn how to cultivate the land and, as a result, they are interested in what crops can be beneficial to their health.
However, the emergence of one field or the digging of a well is preceded by negotiations with African governments, municipal authorities and, naturally, with local elders. It is only then that a field trip is taken.
The role of the translator
“When taking a field trip, we usually leave at six in the morning to get to the place at nine o’clock. Roads are not asphalted so it takes more time,” says Toužimská of People in Need.
On-site, the organisation’s employees assess the situation, talk to local people and start implementing the project.
“We have to report everything to the local authorities. When we take a field trip, they give us a person who visits the local communities with us and translates for us, so the people can tell us what troubles them and how we can help them.”
Communicating with local people is absolutely crucial, according to Toužimská.
“If we present a project and explain to them how it may influence their children’s health, they want to cooperate with us,” she continues.
A similar procedure is used by other organisations, such as CARE, which focuses on assisting vulnerable women and children.
“Our activities are always based on local needs, otherwise it is not possible,” explains Jan Koubek Kejzlar, director of the Czech branch of CARE, who has recently returned from a mission to assist South Sudanese refugees in Uganda.
“We mostly hear words of thanks, but we also always ask about what was wrong from the participants’ point of view,” says Kejzlar.
More support needed for education 
One of the main sources of money for CARE projects is the EU Trust Fund for Africa. “Thanks to the large volume of funds, the interconnection of the programmes, and the cooperation with other partners, these projects have the potential for greater change and benefits,” says Koubek Kejzlar.
The Trust Fund is expected to mobilise up to €3.3 billion. The European Commission wants the funds to tackle the causes of migration and has repeatedly appealed to the member states to contribute to it.
MEPs have pointed out that the EU funds must also support the development of democracy and respect for human rights.
Jana Toužimská of People in Need also believes that insufficient respect for human rights is one of the main problems.
“Countries should give local people more rights, and countries themselves should respect these rights,” says Toužimská.
“The EU is the main supporter of African development, trade and security. But it has to continue investing, especially in education, to give hope to the younger generation,” says French MEP Maurice Ponga, author of the European Parliament’s recent resolution on relations between the European Union and Africa.

                The recent statement by the Visegrad Four on the future of Europe is “an attack on European democracy”, Jo Leinen, a respected federalist MEP (S&D, Germany), said in a strongly-worded statement on Tuesday (30 January), ahead of a key summit in February focusing on the 2019 European elections.
Leinen reacted on his blog to the statement by the four Central European countries (Hungary, Poland, Czech Republic and Slovakia) adopted at a meeting in Budapest last Friday.
The leaders of the four countries agreed their joint stance for future talks among all EU leaders on how to reform the bloc following Britain’s departure next year.


The four #Visegrad countries (CZ, HU, PL and SK) have spoken on the future of Europe: a small ""yes"" to the #Spitzenkandidaten process, a big ""no"" to #transnationallists. That's it for a more democratic #EP2019, isn't it? #V4 https://t.co/5ClpM374Lx
— Oliver Schwarz (@OSchwarzUDE) January 30, 2018

The Visegrad Four are pushing back against proposals for more integration among the remaining 27 EU states, floated by the major western EU powers Germany and France and backed by the European Commission in Brussels.
“EU institutions should treat all member states equally and act strictly within the remits of their respective… competencies. The right of member states to carry out domestic reforms within their competences should be respected,” the statement said.
On migration, the four restated their focus on “effective, responsible and enforceable (EU) external border protection to avoid obligatory quotas (being) applied, which are ineffective and have already divided Europe.”
They also said they should not be punished for having different opinions within the bloc.
Leinen, known for supporting a federal Europe and for playing a part in drafting the European Constitution, said:
“The Visegrad governments call for a Europe of the executives, where decisions are taken in small circles and without proper parliamentary control. They ignore the democratic structure of the European Union and the role of the European Parliament as equal co-legislator. By rejecting democratic improvements such as lead candidates (“Spitzenkandidaten”) for the office of Commission President and transnational lists, they reveal their ignorance for the European voters”.
The Visegrad Statement is not entirely clear on the so-called “Spitzenkandidaten” model for the European elections, which was first used in 2014.  The leaders said that it should not undermine the current balance of institutions and among the member states.
On 23 February, EU leaders will meet for an informal summit to discuss precisely the European Parliament’s makeup after the 2019 elections, possible transnational lists and the procedure for appointing top officials, including the ‘Spitzenkandidaten’.
Decisive summit
Leinen said that before this decisive summit, the Visegrad Four were “on a collision course with the European Parliament and numerous member states.”
“There is a danger of a split not only on single issues but regarding the democratic nature of the European Union. While Emmanuel Macron promotes a sovereign and democratic Europe, Viktor Orbán and Jarosław Kaczyński propagate nationalism and apparently see the European Union only as a source of structural funds”, Leinen said and added:
“It is therefore even more important that the new German government together with France defends European democracy. The coalition agreement should leave no doubt that Germany stands for a democratic European Union that is capable to act”.

                Polish authorities claim that the launch of Article 7 against their country is unjustifiable. Citizens are divided on the issue and nearly half of them believe the Commission is just acting because it does not like the current authorities in Warsaw. EURACTIV Poland reports.
According to a January survey by the Polish Centre for Public Opinion Research (CBOS), 43% of Poles agree the ‘nuclear option’ against Poland is unjustified, while 38% think the opposite. Almost half (46%) think the Commission’s decision was based on a dislike of the current government.
Since the moment the Article 7 procedure on the state of the rule of law in Poland was initiated, Polish government officials were convinced that it was groundless.
President Andrzej Duda said on Monday (29 January) that he “totally disagrees” with the Commission. “I think this is a very unfair treatment that we are facing,” he said in an interview with Polish television channel TVP.
The Polish authorities, Duda explained, had only introduced changes to the legal system that are already in force in other EU countries, but only Poland is accused of violating democracy.
“Let’s take into consideration the real image of our country: we have freedom of association, everyone can demonstrate, there is no problem when it comes to freedom of speech,” said Duda.
Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who only took office in December, also insisted that the launch of Article 7 was unfounded and argued that the country has the right to implement reforms.
Polish public opinion divided
The CBOS survey also shows that for 45% of respondents, this form of pressure on the Polish authorities is unacceptable, while 34% consider it acceptable and 21% said they have no opinion on the matter.
Researchers point out that Poles are also divided over whether the country should heed the Commission’s recommendations and withdraw some of the changes in the judicial system. 44% of respondents believe Poland should meet the Commission’s expectations while 41% think the opposite.
Poles do not fear sanctions, count on Hungary
According to the survey, Poles are not afraid that the current situation will result in sanctions. Although more than a half of the respondents (51%) believe that sanctions could be an option,  the majority are convinced that the Council will fail to secure the unanimity necessary to approve sanctions.
Here, 28% of respondents believe that at least one country would take the Polish side and 35% think it would be more than one – expecting solidarity from post-communist countries like Hungary (77%), the Czech Republic (22%), Slovakia (16%), Bulgaria (14%) and Lithuania (8%), with 7% betting on Germany as well.
At the same time, as many as 87% of respondents (up on 85% in the previous survey), were still in favour of Poland’s presence in the EU and only 10% opposed it.
The survey was carried out on January 9-17 on a sample of 951 adult Poles.



Article 7: The ins and outs of the EU's 'nuclear option' for Poland
The European Commission will decide on Wednesday (26 July) how to deal with the Poland’s reform of its judicial system, which Brussels and the Polish opposition say undermines the judiciary’s independence and violates the EU’s basic principles of the rule of law.

                Maria João Rodrigues, who is emerging as the most prominent figurehead in the European Parliament’s  S&D group, made it plain on Thursday (1 February) that her political group is quite critical of its Romanian affiliate member, the ruling social-democrat PSD.
Portugal’s Rodrigues is the vice-president of the S&D Group responsible for parliamentary affairs but journalists increasingly see her as the new S&D frontwoman, after the departure of group leader Gianni Pittella, who will run for the Senate in the Italian general elections on 4 March.



The Brief – Pittella recrosses the Rubicon
Few could begrudge Gianni Pitella, leader of the Socialist and Democrat group in the European Parliament, his decision to leave the EU capital to stand for the Italian Senate. Trading in grey Brussels days for the warmth of Campania is an understandable decision to make but is it a politically shrewd one?


If he fails in Italy, Pittella could return to the Parliament as an MEP. In the meantime, he would be replaced by the first vice-president, Udo Bullmann (SPD). But if he becomes a senator, S&D MEPs would need to elect a new group leader and Rodrigues is perceived as the strongest candidate.
She appeared quite worried about the possible outcome of the Italian election, seeing a risk that the country could be led by anti-EU forces. “The situation in Italy is extreme,” she said.
One of the issues to be discussed at the Parliament’s February plenary is the rule of law in Romania. The Commission voiced “strong concern” last week at Romania’s controversial plans for judicial reform, warning against “backtracking” on efforts to fight corruption.
The statement was issued by Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and his right-hand man, Frans Timmermans, the most senior social-democrat in the EU executive.



EU warns it may not lift Romania monitoring
The EU on Wednesday (24 January) voiced “concern” at Romania’s controversial plans for judicial reform, warning against “backtracking” on efforts to fight corruption, in the latest clash between Brussels and the bloc’s former communist east.


Juncker received on Wednesday Romanian President Klaus Iohannis, who is at odds with the ruling social-democrats, to express his support, flanked by Romanian Commissioner Corina Crețu, a social-democrat (PSD) in charge of regional policy.
Asked by EURACTIV to make it plain if the S&D is critical of the PSD, she said:
“Yes. We really think that we need to have a fair and effective justice system. If there are question marks, if there are criticisms, and we can see them, we believe that the government should come to the European Parliament and give a proper explanation.”
Minister to be grilled in plenary
Rodrigues said that Romania’s justice minister, Tudorel Toader, was expected to speak in plenary next week and answer questions from MEPs. She said the S&D had asked its Romanian affiliates to explain the judicial reforms and actually obtained such explanations, but said those must be shared in plenary.
Rodrigues made comparisons between the case of Poland, which is under a rule of law procedure and risks triggering Article 7, the “illiberal democracy” in Hungary and the case of Romania, explaining that the cases were different.
She said Poland was clearly a case of systemic threat to the rule of law and her group was in favour of triggering the EU’s nuclear option, Article 7.



European Parliament to vote on 'nuclear option' against Poland
The European Parliament’s justice committee voted on Monday (29 January) in favour of launching the “nuclear option” against Poland. PiS chairman Jarosław Kaczyński insisted that Poland might only face “some impediments, inconveniences.” EURACTIV Poland reports.


Regarding Hungary, she said the country presented a “possible case” for triggering Article 7, but also explained that EU pressure on Viktor Orbán has worked so far.
In the case of Romania, she clearly said it was not a case for the nuclear option. Juncker has also said Romania is not an Article 7 case.
Asked about other issues, Rodrigues pleaded for maintaining the Spitzenkandidat system in the 2019 European elections and hinted that the transnational lists had little chance to come to life due to opposition from member states.
She was categorical that the success of Emmanuel Macron in France was a unique episode, resulting from the peculiarities of the country’s political system.
The good side of the story, she said, is that “Macron came with a pro-European message”. She called Macron’s doctrine “state liberalism” and described him as someone between Tony Blair and the social democrats.

                Brussels expects to see a legally binding document regulating relations between Belgrade and Pristina before Serbia joins the EU and insists on Belgrade’s continued dialogue with Kosovo, European Parliament President Antonio Tajani said in the Serbian capital this week.
Tajani said it was “important for the Union to see a legally binding agreement reached before admission to the EU and all is clear there”.
He did not use the term “full recognition”, a concept many in Serbia reject outright. Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008 and Belgrade has vowed it would never recognise it.
The Parliament president insisted that the EU wants a resumption of the dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina, stressing that Belgrade is extremely important for the stability of the Balkans.

The EU-mediated Belgrade-Pristina dialogue has been stalled for more than a year. The technical dialogue was due to resume earlier in January but the Serbian team returned from Brussels after the news of the assassination of Oliver Ivanović, a Serb leader of the opposition Freedom, Democracy, Justice civic initiative in Kosovska Mitrovica.
A legally binding agreement with Kosovo, whose independence is not recognised by Belgrade and five EU member states, is the key requisite for Serbia’s EU membership. Serbia is a candidate country and has so far opened 12 of the 35 negotiating chapters.
Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić told a joint press conference with Tajani on 31 January that “Tajani gave no warnings” but spoke the truth.
“The EU expects from Serbia a legally binding agreement with Pristina, after which it may join the Union,” he said.
Vučić admitted that the issue of Kosovo – a sensitive issue for many Serbs, who see it as the cradle of Serbian statehood – was “the hardest part of the work left” for Serbia to do on the road to the EU.
Asked about the stance of Spain, which is asking for the exclusion of Kosovo from the European Commission’s Strategy for the Western Balkans because it is not a state, Tajani replied that every EU member state had its own strategies and political choices, but that the Union aimed to achieve a harmonised and unified European foreign policy.
The European Commission, asked by EURACTIV, said that the issue of recognition was “a matter for the member states”.
Tajani said he thought the EU’s position was to favour the Belgrade-Pristina dialogue in an effort to reach a legally acceptable solution before Serbia became a full member. Belgrade insiders say it is a compromise solution that would allow Serbia to avoid formal recognition.
Tajani also said in Belgrade that Serbia had much more to do about the rule of law, constitutional reform and press freedom, adding that he was confident that Serbia would do all that was necessary, just as all EU countries had done.
The Parliament president added that 2018 could be a year of turnabout and that he agreed with the statement by Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, that Serbia and Montenegro might join the EU in 2025, at the earliest.
During the visit, Tajani talked with civil society representatives and Prime Minister Ana Brnabić. He also spoke at the opening of a business event, EU-SERBIA 2018: Investment, Growth and Employment.
Tajani welcomes Vučić’s decision to visit Zagreb
During the visit, Tajani also said that he greatly appreciated the fact that Vučić had accepted an invitation from Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović to visit Zagreb on 12-13 February, in what is to be the first high-level visit in almost two years.
“I appreciate the Serbian president’s response to the invitation to visit Croatia,” said Tajani.
Relations between Serbia and Croatia, another former Yugoslav republic, which joined the EU in 2013, have been up and down in recent years, with numerous issues blocking progress.

“I believe it is important for us to talk and solve problems between the two states. This is not the time for Serbia and Croatia to compete in who will use more heavy words. It is important that we think about what we should and can do together, and look to the future,” said Vučić.
Vučić also said that he would talk with Croatian officials about what needed to be done to help the Serbs in Croatia, stressing that he would ask the Croatian authorities for help in reviving Serb villages and solving the problems of missing persons and property, dating from the bloody collapse of Yugoslavia in the 1990s.

                The race to succeed Jean-Claude Juncker as head of the first post-Brexit European Commission begins later this month – and in typical EU style it is starting with a row about how the race should be run.
While the EU’s French Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier is the rumoured early front runner to take charge of the bloc’s executive arm in 2019, the process itself has not even got off the ground.
At stake is not just a power struggle between national leaders and the European Parliament over who chooses Juncker’s successor, but questions about democracy that could give fresh ammunition to eurosceptics opposed to the EU.
Juncker was picked in 2014 by a new and controversial “Spitzenkandidat” system – German for “lead candidate” – under which the biggest political group in the European Parliament gets to nominate its candidate for the job.



Wieland: ‘Spitzenkandidat genie is well and truly out of the bottle’
In November 2015, the European Parliament supported a reform to the EU electoral law that is intended to make the European elections more attractive. EURACTIV Germany spoke to one of the legislature’s vice-presidents about it.


The European Council of 28 national leaders then makes the final choice, “taking account” of the parliament’s nomination, in the vaguely worded provision of its the EU’s treaties. The whole parliament gets a vote at the end.
But many of those national leaders, who will discuss the issue at a Brussels summit on 23 February oppose what they view as a stitch-up by MEPs that robs countries of their power to pick who will fill one of the continent’s most influential roles.
‘Frustration in capitals’ 
Juncker has said that he will not seek a second term in the job when his term expires next year.



Juncker will not seek second term as European Commission President
Jean-Claude Juncker will not seek a second term as European Commission president, once his first mandate ends in 2019.


European Council President Donald Tusk is expected to lay out options at the leaders’ summit, including whether to continue with the Spitzenkandidat system again next year or reject it.
“In 2014 there was some frustration in a number of capitals that the process which led to the nomination of Juncker was not transparent enough,” a European source said on condition of anonymity.
Foremost among its opponents now is Emmanuel Macron, the youthful new French president spearheading efforts to reform the bloc after Britain’s vote to leave.
Critics say the system has politicised the European Commission, an issue which plays into concerns about national sovereignty versus Brussels, and possibly created the conditions for Brexit itself.
Another fear is that if eurosceptic groups win the next European elections in May 2019 they could pick an outlier candidate – for example France’s Marine Le Pen or Greek former finance minister Yanis Varoufakis – and the EU leaders could then be obliged to back them, sources said.
MEPs however insist that the system countered growing eurosceptics by showing the EU at its most democratic, since it directly involves the parliament, the union’s only directly-elected institution.
“If Emmanuel Macron wants to practise European democracy and solidarity, he has to support the Spitzenkandidat concept,” said Manfred Weber, head of the centre-right European People’s Party, which chose Juncker and is likely to be the biggest group again in 2019.

‘Really good job’ 
So far there are no declared candidates to replace Juncker.
Barnier, a former French foreign minister and European Commissioner, unsuccessfully went up against Juncker for the job in 2014.

“He is well aware of the political capital that he has won with Brexit,” another EU source said.

Francis, speaking to tens of thousands of people in St. Peter’s Square for his weekly blessing, said he was making the appeal because of the “tragic prolonging” of conflicts around the world.
23 February is a Friday in the first full week of the Christian season of Lent, during which fasting from food and extra acts of charity are encouraged as a sign of penitence.
He said “everyone, in their own consciences, before God, should ask ‘what can I do for peace?’”
“Surely, we can pray but not only: each one of us can say ‘no’ to violence in their own way, because victories obtained through violence are false victories, while working for peace benefits all,” he said.
He specifically invited non-Catholics and non-Christians to join the initiative in any way they saw fit, “but all together”.
Francis said the prayers and fasting should be offered in a particular way for the people of the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan.

Conflict is worsening global starvation, the United Nations said on Tuesday (30 January), as it called for greater peacebuilding efforts to end hunger for almost 500 million people living in war zones.

                More people than ever are on the move globally. This raises the need for courageous European leadership and broad-based support from the media to depoliticise refugees and migrants and to free public opinion from irrational fear, writes Idriss Jazairy.
Ambassador Idriss Jazairy is the executive director of the Geneva Centre for Human Rights Advancement and Global Dialogue and the former head of a UN specialised agency, IFAD.
More people than ever are on the move under the centrifugal impulse of globalisation. Fifteen percent of the world’s population or one billion of the Earth’s seven billion people are considered as people on the move. Host developing countries or societies bear the brunt of those that flee from their homes. 
There are 740 million internally displaced people. On top of this, the world is home to 244 million international migrants and 22.5 million refugees. The world has thus never witnessed a more complex and massive movement of people since the end of the Second World War. 
Yet, attempts to deny the inevitability of global human mobility and to demonize globalization until recently hailed as an expression of “the magic of the market”, are the preferred responses to the protracted migrant and refugee crisis.
On-going armed conflict and indiscriminate terrorist attacks in their wake as well as climate change have brought bereavement principally to the Middle East and the North Africa (MENA) region and are spilling over to other regions including Europe. 
This has given rise to an exacerbation of human rights violations in societies in the MENA region. More than 10 million people in Syria, Sudan, Iraq, and Yemen have been forcibly displaced from their home societies or countries owing to the rise of extremist violence and to water scarcity. 
Thousands of refugees and migrants undertake perilous and treacherous journeys in a desperate search for a better and a safer future. Only a small proportion of these goes to destination countries that are advanced and prosperous societies and who champion human rights and democracy. 
Yet this is where the backlash is now occurring. Thus, the aspirations of “huddled masses” for a safer and better life remain in limbo as multilateralism and consensus building are being challenged by unilateralism, populism and political adventurism. 
Extremism and populism are being mainstreamed in the rich world. Eastern Europe is threatening the democratic traditions of a continent referred to as the birthplace of democracy. The electoral outcomes in numerous European countries illustrate that populist parties are emerging as credible political actors. 
Although the displaced only account for 0.2% of Europe’s population, short-term perceptions of national interests and fearmongering together with an outburst of identity politics downgrade human rights and specifically the need to respond to the plight of people on the move.
How can one overcome these challenges that threaten to destabilize peace and stability in the world? 
On 14 December 2017, a coalition of civil society organizations and specialists adopted the 2017 Geneva Declaration entitled “Mobility and human solidarity, a challenge and an opportunity for Europe and the MENA region.” This declaration was signed by representatives of 12 organizations worldwide who were driven by the idea that the migrant and refugee crisis can be addressed through dialogue and joint action.
To achieve this noble goal, the Geneva Declaration calls upon international decision-makers to uphold the view that global human mobility can become the driving force of social progress. It appeals to decision-makers in the Arab region and the West to identify equitable burden- and responsibility-sharing mechanisms to provide protection to people on the move. 
Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey host displaced people that may add up to 25%, 20% and 3% of these countries’ populations respectively. The burden has thus been put on poorer countries to deal with a complex situation that is not of their doing. 
Attempts in prosperous societies to “fortify” and seal off borders exacerbate the plight of these people on the move. It contributes to the criminalization of migrants and refugees. 
The Declaration echoes the need to enhance the fairness of responsibility-sharing mechanisms for hosting displaced, mostly young, people guided by the principles of international solidarity, justice and, why not acknowledge it, of long-term self-interest of host countries where the proportion of the elderly keeps increasing. This is an occasion for all to keep alive the lofty aims of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. 
A key outcome of the Declaration is the joint call to action to establish a Global Charter to enhance the protection of the rights of people on the move. 
The refugee and migrant crisis has ceased to be rational and is being caught up in an emotional whirlwind. The Global Charter should caution the EU against “externalising” or “outsourcing” compassion to people on the move or envisioning the situation merely as a security and border control issue. 
European officials must consider global human mobility as a human right, and not just as an issue of protection. Nor should selective compassion and selective mercy for people on the move be allowed to prevail. A multilateral task force should be put in place to coordinate the implementation of the Global Compact for Migration, the Global Compact on Refugees and hopefully the future Global Charter. 
Global human mobility must not be considered as an obstacle to the social progress of societies. Societies that demonstrate respect for human dignity are the ones most likely to be winners in the long run. 
There is a need for courageous European leadership and broad-based support from the media to “depoliticise” the issue of refugees and migrants and to free public opinion from the irrational fear that has gripped it in this regard.

More than 10 million people in Syria, Sudan, Iraq, and Yemen have been forcibly displaced from their home societies or countries owing to the rise of extremist violence and to water scarcity. Thousands of refugees and migrants undertake perilous and treacherous journeys in a desperate search for a better and a safer future. Only a small proportion of these goes to destination countries that are advanced and prosperous societies and who champion human rights and democracy. Yet this is where the backlash is now occurring. Thus, the aspirations of “huddled masses” for a safer and better life remain in limbo as multilateralism and consensus building are being challenged by unilateralism, populism and political adventurism. Extremism and populism are being mainstreamed in the rich world. Eastern Europe is threatening the democratic traditions of a continent referred to as the birthplace of democracy. The electoral outcomes in numerous European countries illustrate that populist parties are emerging as credible political actors. Although the displaced only account for 0.2% of Europe’s population, short-term perceptions of national interests and fearmongering together with an outburst of identity politics downgrade human rights and specifically the need to respond to the plight of people on the move. How can one overcome these challenges that threaten to destabilize peace and stability in the world? On 14 December 2017, a coalition of civil society organizations and specialists adopted the 2017 Geneva Declaration entitled “Mobility and human solidarity, a challenge and an opportunity for Europe and the MENA region.” This declaration was signed by representatives of 12 organizations worldwide who were driven by the idea that the migrant and refugee crisis can be addressed through dialogue and joint action. To achieve this noble goal, the Geneva Declaration calls upon international decision-makers to uphold the view that global human mobility can become the driving force of social progress. It appeals to decision-makers in the Arab region and the West to identify equitable burden- and responsibility-sharing mechanisms to provide protection to people on the move. Lebanon, Jordan, and Turkey host displaced people that may add up to 25%, 20% and 3% of these countries’ populations respectively. The burden has thus been put on poorer countries to deal with a complex situation that is not of their doing. Attempts in prosperous societies to “fortify” and seal off borders exacerbate the plight of these people on the move. It contributes to the criminalization of migrants and refugees. The Declaration echoes the need to enhance the fairness of responsibility-sharing mechanisms for hosting displaced, mostly young, people guided by the principles of international solidarity, justice and, why not acknowledge it, of long-term self-interest of host countries where the proportion of the elderly keeps increasing. This is an occasion for all to keep alive the lofty aims of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. A key outcome of the Declaration is the joint call to action to establish a Global Charter to enhance the protection of the rights of people on the move. The refugee and migrant crisis has ceased to be rational and is being caught up in an emotional whirlwind. The Global Charter should caution the EU against “externalising” or “outsourcing” compassion to people on the move or envisioning the situation merely as a security and border control issue. European officials must consider global human mobility as a human right, and not just as an issue of protection. Nor should selective compassion and selective mercy for people on the move be allowed to prevail. A multilateral task force should be put in place to coordinate the implementation of the Global Compact for Migration, the Global Compact on Refugees and hopefully the future Global Charter. Global human mobility must not be considered as an obstacle to the social progress of societies. Societies that demonstrate respect for human dignity are the ones most likely to be winners in the long run. There is a need for courageous European leadership and broad-based support from the media to “depoliticise” the issue of refugees and migrants and to free public opinion from the irrational fear that has gripped it in this regard. Further Reading The real wave of refugees is yet to come Climate change in Africa is going to be a much stronger driving force for mass migration than political turmoil, writes Tara Shirvani.",45

                Curbing corruption is not a quick-fix and there is no single universal cure for it. However, there is more hope than ever that the endemic spread of corruption can be contained and ultimately reduced, argues Adina Turk.
Adina Trunk is a programme officer at International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA). Trunk has previously worked with political parties and democracy development as a manager for the Eastern Europe programme at the party-affiliated organization KIC Sweden.
How corrupt can a politician be before they should be considered a criminal? In Romania’s case, the answer is quite clear: 200,000 Euros. 
According to a draft bill adopted by the lower house of Parliament earlier this month, abuse of office would no longer be considered a criminal offence if the sums involved were less than 200,000 Euros. In one of the European Union’s poorest and most corrupt countries, where the average monthly salary is below 500 Euros (net), this bill was the straw that broke the camel’s back. 
Almost half a million people, both in the capital and other cities, braved the bitter winter weather to protest against proposals which critics say could jeopardize Romania’s rule of law and dismantle democracy. It is not the first time Romanians have taken to the streets to show their indignation about how politicians misuse their power. 
In the past two years, the country has been shaken by several large anti-corruption protests, leading to temporary and short-lived victories for the protesters. In effect, however, these laws, attempting to amend the penal code to help corrupted politicians to escape justice were slightly revised and re-tabled, leading to a groundhog-day feeling amongst the protesters this winter. 
Sadly enough, Romania’s path is not an exception, from a global and a historical perspective. Data from International IDEA’s new Global State of Democracy (GSoD) Indices covering 155 countries between 1975-2015 show that reducing levels of corruption has proven to be the most difficult task for democracies around the world. 
Moreover, the indices show that whilst most other democratic aspects such as representative government, fundamental rights and participatory engagement have improved in the past 40 years, corruption levels have remained the same since 1975, in spite of more efforts being made to curb this development. Implementing the rule of law in public administration tends to be difficult to change both in the short and medium terms. 
This could partially explain the dissatisfaction with democracy seen in many electoral democracies emerging after 1975 (Source: International IDEA, The Global State of Democracy, 2017).
Corruption scandals affect perceptions of democracy. They cause citizens to lose trust in political parties, politicians, and institutions and inspire protest and deep indignation. In addition, recurring corruption undermines the integrity of the political system by making it vulnerable to capture by counterparts offering so-called “big money”. 
This further increases the perception of politics as a method for self-enrichment for the existing elite, leaving even more people with a sense of despair, disillusionment, and disappointment. 
“Big money” also provides a disproportionate advantage to a selected few, undermines effective public service delivery, and creates an uneven playing field especially for women and marginalized groups. When large bank accounts are needed to participate in elections or to hold prominent positions in a party, the system will benefit the existing elite, thereby widening the gap between the elected and the electorate. 
And when the ones in power propose new laws to further protect their way of life, not only is trust lost, but also hope – hope that the democratic system could be a warrant against corruption and misuse of power. In addition, current measures to combat these problems often fall short, since they have a limited scope and the institutions that are supposed to enforce them are limited with constraints, while political parties face little accountability. 
So, what is needed to curb corruption, restore trust and protect democracy? Instead of constantly adding to the number of mechanisms, actors and legal restrictions to curb corruption, a wider, holistic approach, focusing on the most effective solutions, should be considered. 
The integrity of democratic politics should be protected throughout the political cycle and on a permanent basis. This includes mechanisms for political competition that focus on public official vulnerabilities to corruption, such as conflict of interest, lobbying, bank and tax secrecy rules, parliamentary immunity norms, protections for whistleblowers and the freedom of the press. 
This more holistic approach should include a combination of improved anti-corruption mechanisms, new oversight instruments led by a variety of social and political actors, and enhanced political party regulations. 
In addition, improved anti-money laundering systems, a vibrant civil society, a media that can effectively function as a watchdog, and crowdfunding efforts to raise many small donations as a counterbalance to big money, could all be effective actions. 
In Europe, it has become increasingly evident that corruption levels should play a greater role both pre- and post-accession to the European Union. Current efforts to make anti-corruption reform in the Western Balkans a key requirement for EU accession are a case in point but similar requirements should also be put in place for already existing EU members. 
Corruption levels could, for example, be linked to EU-members possibility to access or be eligible for EU funds or grants. GRECO’s evaluations could serve as a source of monitoring in this regard as well as corruption levels measured by indexes such as “The Global State of Democracy Indices”. 
The European Parliament could support national parliaments to enhance their capacity for oversight over state spending, for example by setting up peer-to-peer exchanges and capacity building between national parliaments.  In addition, the European Commission, member states and international organizations could continue to support initiatives and independent organizations that aim to curb the opportunities for corruption, increase transparency and reveal misuse of funds.
Curbing corruption is not a quick-fix and there is no single universal cure for it. By combining the most effective treatments, however, there is more hope than ever that the endemic spread of corruption can be contained and ultimately reduced. There is a chance for both hope and trust to re-appear in society, leaving fewer people with the sentiment that the only solution is to take to the streets shivering in the winter cold.

                The EU was supposed to enable us all to take part in the energy transition and help make Europe’s economy a low-carbon one. It’s easy to see why the member states would be against this but it’s more surprising that the Parliament is not championing citizens’ clean energy hopes.
In November 2016, the European Commission tabled a bold proposal to create a ‘clean energy’ market for the 21st century:
Millions of households, schools, farms and hospitals placing solar panels on their rooftops, generating their own electricity and selling the surplus back to the grid. Millions more plugging in their electric car to a socket inside their homes and offices, contributing to balancing the grid and stabilising the power system.
Entire neighbourhoods generating their own wind, solar or biogas and sharing the benefits among themselves in so-called “energy communities”. Millions of jobs created in the installation and maintenance of these small-scale renewable energy facilities, contributing to the revival of rural areas.
That was the revolutionary vision at the centre of the ‘Clean Energy for all Europeans’ package, championed by Commissioners Šefčovič and Cañete.
One could be forgiven for expecting EU member states to resist such a sweeping revolution. After all, governments are often the advocates of their former energy monopolies, which for the most part, have a vested interest in defending the traditional model of centralised electricity generation, built around large-scale power plants. And indeed, they didn’t disappoint.
By the same token, one should expect the European Parliament – as the institution representing the interest of ordinary citizens – to put up a fight and defend the European Commission’s bold vision.
Well, don’t hold your breath. Krišjānis Kariņš, a Latvian lawmaker from the European People’s Party (EPP), has drafted a report on the Commission’s proposed new electricity market design, which lays down rules on how power is going to be generated and traded in the years ahead.
And he has just about deleted every provision contained in the Commission’s initial proposal that would have protected small producers of renewable energy from the vagaries of the market.
His justification is as simple as liberal economic theory. “Providing exemptions to some market participants means discriminating against others, which fundamentally undermines the market structure,” he writes in his draft report.
But like many things, theory and reality can be very different. A farmer or a hospital warden placing solar panels on their roof cannot be expected to fill in the same kind of paperwork as a big energy utility owning a park of nuclear power stations. And it would be foolish to expect a small producer to fight on equal terms with a multi-billion-euro energy behemoth.
Yet, this is more or less what the Kariņš report is asking them to do. And where exemptions have been granted, he wants them scrapped over time.
It remains to be seen whether other lawmakers in the European Parliament will back the ultra-liberal views defended by the US-educated Kariņš. The Socialists and Democrats (S&D), the Greens/EFA and leftist GUE/NGL groups have certainly decided to side with the Commission’s bold vision.
But it is still unclear where other groups will stand – notably the European People’s Party (EPP) and the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE). A vote in the Parliament’s industry committee is scheduled for 21 February.
Beware, the energy counter-revolution is nigh.
The Roundup
After hundreds of thousands protested in Athens about the ongoing Macedonia name dispute, the Commission refused to involve itself further in the fracas.
UK Brexit chief David Davis hosted EU counterpart Barnier to step up talks over the transition deal and future EU-UK (trade) relations. Negotiations will continue on the fundamental issues tomorrow. Ryanair has reiterated that the UK is underestimating the disruption Brexit will have.
The race to succeed Jean-Claude Juncker as head of the first post-Brexit European Commission begins later this month, with a row about how the race should be run. Look out for our coverage from Strasbourg.
In the Brussels game of ‘spot the next Commission chief’, Europe’s pygmy politics are setting a high barrier for the establishment of a proper EU foreign policy, argues Friends of Europe’s Giles Merritt.
After a week of coalition talks, the cornerstones of a new government programme seem to be set but some “plot holes” still have to be closed before Germany makes its comeback in the European arena.
Insisting on full membership of the bloc is the only option, after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan rejected proposals for a mere partnership with the EU.
There is no single universal and quick cure for corruption. However, there is hope for containment, writes Adina Turk of the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance.
Promoting entrepreneurship among women in low-income neighbourhoods can be a solution to the unemployment problem in Europe. Read how a project of the French international business school HEC tries to tackle the problem.
Plastic has become increasingly unpopular with the public. But life without it might look very different when it comes to the Commission’s new Plastics Strategy. Read our summary of the current state-of-play.
Look out for…
The debate on the future of Europe and the fate of the controversial “Spitzenkandidat” concept in tomorrow’s Strasbourg plenary.

                The European conservatives are opposed to the project of transnational lists for the European elections, but risk losing during the vote on the matter on 6 February. Alain Lamassoure said in an interview with EURACTIV.fr
Alain Lamassoure is a European People’s Party (EPP) MEP. Having supported Alain Juppé during The Republicans’ primary elections, he left the right-wing party last October. He spoke with EURACTIV France Editor-in-Chief Aline Robert. 
Does the European People’s Party support Macron’s project of transnational lists for the next European elections in 2019?
No, the EPP is against it and will vote against it during the plenary session on 6 February. However, this will not stop the project as most of the other parties are for it. Ironically, even eurosceptics, who usually defend their nation, are for transnational lists. Because the more broader the lists, the more chances there are of having elected representatives.
Where does the idea of transnational lists come from?
It is quite a crazy idea, those transitional lists. It’s the mad idea of federalists who brought it forward 40 years ago at the European Parliament, the Parliament has since then, voted dozens of times on the subject. At the time, the European Parliament had no power, it was a way of making it visible. However, ever since the Lisbon Treaty, it now has real powers, especially when it comes to law-making, which reinforces the need for democratic control, and proximity to the elector.
Does this type of list exist elsewhere?
No other country, not even federal, has applied such a system, not the U.S, not Germany. The proportional voting system already alienates voters and their representatives in regards to local constituencies. Democratic logic wants that representatives are accountable to the voters who know them.  Therefore, having a national list, such as the one adopted in France for the European elections, that’s already a mistake. A transnational list that’s even worse.
Why is a national list a mistake according to you? 
Well, because the potential candidates are already starting to lick the boots of party leaders in order to be on the 2019 lists. However, they should be campaigning locally, and be accountable to their voters and not to their party leaders. On a national list, taking right-wing parties, for example, we know that the first 20 candidates on the list will be elected.
What would work well is allowing the preferential vote to voters: so that they can rank their elected representatives as they please. This would force candidates to campaign harder in their region rather than to Laurent Wauquiez (leader of The Republicans) or Emmanuel Macron.
Do you think that transnational lists could see the day for the 2019 elections?
I think there is little chance! The European Parliament gives a non-binding advisory opinion, but then the electoral system needs to be changed, and this has to be done unanimously across the member states. I know that nowadays France is trying to convince smaller countries who are completely unfavourable to the idea, as they will never get any representatives elected on such lists seeing as their policies are hardly known.  Therefore, we would need to make concessions to Slovenia or Hungary in other areas, all for this fancy list? I find that inappropriate.
Realistically, there are no chances of making all the national parliaments vote on the subject, in such a short length of time.
Alain Juppé, who you supported during the presidential elections, is now siding with Macron for the European elections. What about you?
The idea of gathering people that support his European policies beyond party positions, for the European elections, seems very appropriate to me. And it is politically smart: these elections will happen in the middle of his mandate, the reforms that he will have implemented by then won’t be very popular. So, this Europe-wide recruitment is logical.
If so will you be a candidate?
I could have been, but I am turning 75 next year, so no. What is certain though is that I left The Republicans, and I am proud of it, it is from now on a moderate Eurosceptic party. Macron’s list makes more sense to the pro-European French right wing.



Reality catches up with Macron’s projects of European democracy
Citizen consultations, transnational lists: France is trying to carry out Macron’s project for Europe but ambition has been scaled down. EURACTIV France reports.

Therefore, we would need to make concessions to Slovenia or Hungary in other areas, all for this fancy list? I find that inappropriate. Realistically, there are no chances of making all the national parliaments vote on the subject, in such a short length of time. Alain Juppé, who you supported during the presidential elections, is now siding with Macron for the European elections. What about you? The idea of gathering people that support his European policies beyond party positions, for the European elections, seems very appropriate to me. And it is politically smart: these elections will happen in the middle of his mandate, the reforms that he will have implemented by then won’t be very popular. So, this Europe-wide recruitment is logical. If so will you be a candidate? I could have been, but I am turning 75 next year, so no. What is certain though is that I left The Republicans, and I am proud of it, it is from now on a moderate Eurosceptic party. Macron’s list makes more sense to the pro-European French right wing. Reality catches up with Macron’s projects of European democracy Citizen consultations, transnational lists: France is trying to carry out Macron’s project for Europe but ambition has been scaled down.

                Ahead of Wednesday’s vote in the European Parliament, eight influential politicians from all the leading European parties explain why transnational lists will benefit European democracy.
This opinion piece was written by a cross-party group of eight influential MEPs working on electoral reform in the European Parliament. They are listed below.
On Wednesday (7 February), the plenary of the European Parliament will decide on its composition after Brexit. A controversy has emerged especially on the question if a part of the 73 British seats should be used for the introduction of transnational lists, as proposed by French President Emmanuel Macron and Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. 
We want to answer the most frequent arguments brought forward by opponents of the concept and explain why we think transnational lists would be good for European democracy.
Let us first recall that the European Parliament has called for the introduction of transnational lists on numerous occasions. The first time, in 1998, in the report of then Vice-President of the European Parliament Georgios Anastassopoulos, and most recently in the Parliament’s proposal for a reform of the European electoral law in November 2015. Transnational lists are a well-established demand of the European Parliament.
Transnational lists are not a danger to European democracy, but on the contrary, would enable European citizens to directly vote for their preferred lead candidate, thus completing the innovation of the 2014 elections, when Parliament successfully defended its prerogative to elect the head of the Executive, as is the right of every Parliament in a parliamentary democracy
A fundamental problem of the European elections is the fact that they are not at all European, but the sum of national election laws, election lists, and of national election campaigns. Forty years after the introduction of direct elections to the European Parliament, it is high time to give these elections a real European dimension.
European elections should focus on European politics and not be used as national “second-order elections”.
 Such constituency would bypass the current link between the members and their electorate. Therefore building upon a more distant and centralized Union, rather than a more democratic and accountable one.
No, it would not. The link would never have been stronger. One person, one vote. No matter where you live. Transnational lists are good for voters. They give them more power at the expense of backroom deals. People will decide who becomes the next Commission president.
 The transnational list would be perceived as a drift to centralism.
Transnational lists are an additional element and not replacing the current system. As we have the unique opportunity to use a part of the British seats for transnational lists, no member state will lose a seat due to their introduction. Citizens will still have their representative in the constituency, just as it has been before.
 The list would most probably be utilised by populist movements that would then get further visibility and capitalise on extremist views around Europe.
This is a very defensive argument. So, we cannot win against populist and nationalist movements in a Europe-wide democratic competition? We shouldn’t be afraid of democracy. Transnational lists will be used by parties of all political directions and it is our job to win the hearts and minds of the people by having the better arguments.
 Transnational lists do not promote democracy; indeed they subvert its logic to an elitist top-down approach.
Voters will get two votes instead of one: they will have twice as much direct influence as they have now. If anything, it will increase democracy and not diminish it. Transnational lists are neither elitist nor top-down. The lists would be established by the members of the European political parties, which are the national parties and individual members, in a transparent and democratic procedure. The process reflects the nomination of lead candidates, which are not perceived as elitist or top-down.
 Collecting protest votes all over Europe, populists could end up choosing the next candidate to be president of the European Commission in the next legislature.
Populists can only choose the president of the European Commission if they win a majority in the European Parliament – which would mean that we did a very bad job. It is the Parliament that elects the Commission president. If this argument were valid, why would all populist and national forces be opposing transnational lists?
 A European constituency (whose existence is yet far from being agreed upon) would expand the already existing gap between smaller and larger member states.
No, it wouldn’t. In the Council, the French government presented a detailed proposal for the implementation of transnational lists with safeguards to prohibit an over-representation of larger member states:
Each list must consist of candidates from at least one-third of the member states
The share of nationals from one member state must not exceed 25%
The first seven candidates on the list must be nationals from different member states
Lists shall alternate between candidates of different member states
 It would launch a debate on the status of the MEPs, whether elected through national or transnational lists.
In several of our member states, MPs are elected directly and also through lists. Never has there been any problem in national parliaments between the differently elected MPs. Additionally, in the European Parliament, MEPs are elected in different ways and in constituencies of different sizes and requiring a different number of votes.
 Besides, in the absence of a European constituency, it is hard to know to which citizens these putative transnational list MEPs would be accountable.
The Lisbon-treaty, Art. 14 (2) TEU clearly states that “the European Parliament shall be composed of representatives of the Union’s citizens”. Therefore all MEPs, elected on national or European lists, would be accountable to all European citizens.
At the end of the day, a possible transnational list cannot be adopted without the necessary legal basis, which is currently not provided either in the Treaties or in EU Electoral Law.
As the proposal for the Report on the Composition of Parliament clearly states, the European electoral law needs to be adapted to establish a European wide constituency. At the same time, the decision on the composition needs to cater for the necessary seats. Both legal acts are necessary for the creation of transnational lists. The wording of the Report on the composition of Parliament is clear and legally sound in this regard.
 Not even the most successfully integrated federations, such as the United States, Switzerland, and Germany, have a single national constituency.
The European Union is a federal entity sui generis, and not an integrated federation as the United States, Germany or Switzerland. In federal states, an integrated party system is usually in place. Thus, in all parts, the same parties run for election. In the European Union, this is not the case. Transnational lists would finally free the electoral campaigns from their national limitations.



Why transnational lists are not a good idea
The Parliament and Council are set to decide on what to do with the 73 seats currently held by British MEPs. However, leaning towards transnational lists is not the answer because it is un-European and undemocratic, writes Gunnar Hökmark.


We are convinced now there is a unique window of opportunity. Because of the exit of the UK from the European Union, no member state will lose a seat in the European Parliament. 
Both acts necessary to establish a joint constituency, the reform of the European electoral law and the composition of the Parliament, are under consideration at the moment. And, many member states are in favour of this innovation. Besides France, Spain, Italy, Ireland, and Belgium, all southern member states, including Portugal, have voiced their support.

                France announces a €200 million allocation for education during the Conference of the Global Partnership for Education. Funding for education will well and truly be France’s priority in terms of development aid for the next few years.  EURACTIV.fr reports.
Following the conference, organised by the Global Partnership for Education (GPE), the only international fund dedicated to education, President Emmanuel Macron announced that France would increase its financial contribution to €200 million for the 2018-2020 period.
It’s a considerable increase of the French contribution, which accounted for €17 million in the 2014-2017 period.
France has now become the fourth biggest donor in the GPE, behind the United-Kingdom, which announced a €417 million contribution, the EU (€400 million), and Norway (€260 million). This European rallying has largely contributed to the financial success of the conference. All donor countries collected in total  $2.3 billion, according to a statement.



Education goal far from reached, UNESCO warns
Only a third of the world’s governments have acccomplished all of the measurable Education for All (EFA) goals set in the 2000 MDGs, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) announced today (9 April).


However, this success still remains below the expectations of the GPE, which hoped to collect $3.1 billion. However, the target could be met, as important donor countries such as Germany and the Netherlands have not yet announced their final contribution.
“The unprecedented support today, means that the GPE can continue to focus on the most excluded and vulnerable children and work to extend assistance to up to 89 countries, which are home to 870 million children and 78% of the world’s out-of-school children,” said Alice Albright, the chief executive officer of the Global Partnership for Education.
Education for all
Founded in 2002, the Global Partnership for Education helps developing countries support access to education. In return, recipient countries commit to devoting a minimum of 20% of their budget to education, a much higher figure than the average in developed countries.
“As a recipient country, it is up to us to increase our efforts in favour of education, this is what we are doing in Senegal by setting aside  25.48% of our budget towards education and training,” stated the Senegalese President Macky Sall, who co-hosted the event along with Macron.
In the fight for access to education, Senegal sets a good example. The country’s gross rate of primary schooling went from 67.2% to 84.6% in the space of five years.
Priority to girls
International rallying for education should particularly benefit schooling for girls. According to data published by the GPE, the probability of girls being excluded from primary school is one and half times higher than it is for boys.



A renewed commitment for education aid?
After many years of being passed over in silence, education aid is now gaining importance on the international agenda. The conference of the Global Partnership for Education on 1 and 2 February will be a key event. EURACTIV.fr reports


 In countries subject to instability or conflict, the schooling gap is even wider as 37% more girls than boys do not attend primary school.
During his speech, Macron called for international aid on girls’ schooling a priority. “Because wherever an obscurantism agenda is promoted to the detriment of democracy, girls are taken out of school,” he stated.
“France has answered the call […] However the Dakar objective has not been reached and there are still numerous challenges to overcome in order to allow 130 million girls to attend school around the world”, said Friederike Röder, the director for France of the NGO ONE.
“Education is really at the forefront of the struggle for peace and development,” added Macky Sall.
French aid to be revealed
The priority given to education in developing countries should also be reflected in France’s budget. ”Education aid will also be a priority for bilateral aid through the French Development Agency”, stated Emmanuel Macron during his closing speech.
Following the presidential campaign, Macron made a commitment to increase French government aid funds for development to 0,55% of gross national income, however, real commitments are still to be made.
On 8 February a meeting of the Interministerial Committee for International Cooperation and Development (CICID) will take place, where a roadmap for France’s government aid is due to be disclosed.

                A probe into illegal practices of Swiss drugmaker Novartis in Greece, involving thousands of state officials and doctors, has opened the Pandora’s Box in Greek politics as local media have named ten former bigwigs from opposition parties as being targeted by the investigation.
Kathimerini, a prominent daily newspaper, reported that it is not clear which category of charges the ten politicians named would face if their immunity from prosecution is lifted. But it said prosecutors are seeking to probe eight former ministers, the 2012 caretaker Prime Minister Panayiotis Pikrammenos and former prime minister Antonis Samaras.
Most of the ten belong either to the opposition conservative New Democracy party or the Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) including the current Governor of the Bank of Greece Yiannis Stournaras.
All the politicians denied the allegations while New Democracy party accused the government of interfering with the course of the investigation.
“I have been informed of the (prime minister’s) latest effort to slander me,” former Prime Minister Samaras said. “But slander is the weapon of cowards […] those behind this attack will answer for their actions in court.”
Avramopoulos reacts
Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos, whose name was among the ten, also denied any involvement.
“During the period I was the minister of health, from 2006 to 2009, the medicine policy and its pricing were not within the competence of the health ministry and therefore I had no, nor could I have, connection to this issue.”
Justice Minister Stavros Kontonis said the large scale of illegal practices has “caused annual state expenditure on medicine to explode.” His deputy Dimitris Papangelopoulos called the affair “the biggest scandal since the creation of the modern Greek state.”
Government sources said that the Novartis scandal has international dimensions but that Greece is critical as it was the “reference country” for drug pricing in 29 countries of the world.
The investigation was launched in mid-December 2016 with evidence of bribery of thousands of state officials and doctors in order for Novartis to get preferential treatment in the market. The Greek probe followed a two-year investigation conducted by the US authorities on the methods Novartis allegedly used to prevail in the market.
The Swiss drugmaker issued a statement stating that it was aware of the media reports about its business practices in Greece and that it was continuing to cooperate with the authorities to shed light on the case.
The prosecutors submitted the relevant documents to the Supreme Court on Tuesday and the case will now be forwarded to the House, as politicians are also allegedly involved in the case file.



Novartis under scrutiny for alleged pharma scandal in Greece
The Greek government launched an official investigation into pharmaceutical giant Novartis, following the publication of allegations of corruption and bribery in national news media.


Pro-government newspapers reported that the scandal could deal a severe blow to the old establishment, which had led the country to the financial deadlock.
FBI investigates
They also reported that the US and Greek authorities fully cooperated in the investigation and that a team of FBI executives and prosecutors had recently visited Greece.
Speaking to the Athens-Macedonian News Agency (AMNA), Kontonis commented: “It is a big and serious case, it has economic aspects as well as ethical and international parameters.”
“In a period of economic crisis and recession that made it difficult for many poor fellows to find the necessary medicines for their health, there were pharmaceutical companies that, in an illegal and provocative way, operated in the direction of drug over costing or delivering drugs, via perjurer civil servants of the National Health System, where they should not,” the leftist minister said.
“For this reason, pharmaceutical spending has skyrocketed in recent years to double the EU spending on pharmaceuticals,” Kontonis added.
Commenting on the opposition reaction, Kontonis called it “ridiculous” and disclosed that the high point the case reached today was the result of an investigation that lasted for more than one year.

Commenting on the opposition reaction, Kontonis called it “ridiculous” and disclosed that the high point the case reached today was the result of an investigation that lasted for more than one year.",51

                The Parliament and Council are set to decide on what to do with the 73 seats currently held by British MEPs. However, leaning towards transnational lists is not the answer because it is un-European and undemocratic, writes Gunnar Hökmark.
Gunnar Hökmark is the head of the Swedish EPP delegation in the Parliament.
The Parliament and the Council will now vote on the 73 seats currently held by British members of the European Parliament. The proposal that was voted in the Constitutional Affairs Committee encompasses a redistribution of seats, a reduction of the number of total seats, and the introduction of Transnational lists. 
The idea of Transnational lists, where MEPs are voted without constituencies and without responsibility, is un-European and undemocratic and should be rejected once and for all.
In a time when people are experiencing a confidence gap between voters and political representatives, it would be a mistake to widen the gap even further. Removing the electoral constituencies in favour of the European political groups would weaken the link between members and their electorate, and consequently, the Parliament would get MEPs without local support. 
This creates a more distant and centralised Union, rather than a more democratic and accountable one.



Why transnational lists are good for European democracy
Ahead of Wednesday’s vote in the European Parliament, eight influential politicians from all the leading European parties explain why transnational lists will benefit European democracy.


Transnational lists would strengthen the populists and the counterparts of Farage, Le Pen and Wilders, who have strong rhetoric against the very idea of the European Union but no intention discuss the challenges we face and to take responsibility. 
They are the ones who benefit from the lack of scrutiny from a defined electorate. And the losers would be the citizens of Europe. A so-called European constituency with accountability to no one would make the EU a project for the elites instead of a Union rooted in the realities of our citizens. 
The good aspects of the report from AFCO are the redistribution of seats to balance under-representation and the reduction of the total number of seats. This enables the Parliament to create new seats for the new member states in a future enlargement, which should continue to be a priority for the Union.
The success of the European Union stems from the combination of a visionary idealism with a realistic pragmatism. Our common challenges need to be met with a united response, but the idea that more centralisation equals more Europe is misguided. 
European citizens benefit from EU legislation through trade, freedom of movement, a common telecom market and increased cooperation in our foreign and security policy, but Europe goes beyond the institutions in Brussels and Strasbourg. Europe is its countries, regions, villages, and citizens.
The words “united in diversity” are not only about unity but also about diversity. One cannot have one without the other. The dynamism and strength of Europe come from balancing national and European interests, small and big countries, different EU institutions, political parties, and regions.
When not even national federations such as Germany and the United States have one single national constituency, why should Europe, which is not a federation, have one? Rather than reforming the electoral law to escape responsibility, politicians in Brussels should reconnect with their voters and initiate dialogues on how to shape the future of Europe. 
That would be truly European and democratic. And requires Parliamentarians rooted in their electorates.

                The EU is so rich in good quotes. Some are so good they can apply for a very, very long time. Today’s Western Balkans developments provided a trip down memory lane.
“I am politically realistic enough to recognise the problem of hostility to enlargement. Frankly, Europe has the blues about many issues. The enlargement blues are directly related to people’s concerns about globalisation, immigration, the future direction of European integration, and a host of other issues.”
“In my view, the only way to overcome the blues is to revitalise the whole European project.”
“In some founding member states, such as Germany and France, opposition to enlargement does not stem only or even mostly from fear of the Polish plumber or cultural rejection of Turkey. Rather, it is because people feel that they don’t know where the European project is heading.”
No, these quotes do not come from Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, who addressed MEPs today (6 February) to present the executive’s new Strategy for the Western Balkans, or from one of his Commissioners (although there are many similarities).
It was the former Enlargement Commissioner, Olli Rehn, who said those words in a speech he delivered on 11 October 2006. At the time, I covered his speech as a journalist in Bulgaria and penned an article called “The Enlargement Blues Speech”.
More than eleven years have passed since then. And it’s been almost 15 years since the Thessaloniki EU-Western Balkans summit but speechwriters can still copy-paste from the old documents.
Quote from Thessaloniki Conclusions:
“The EU reiterates its unequivocal support to the European perspective of the Western Balkan countries. The future of the Balkans is within the European Union.” 
“The countries of the region fully share the objectives of economic and political union and look forward to joining an EU that is stronger in the pursuit of its essential objectives and more present in the world.”
And lastly, some quotes from the BBC European affairs correspondent William Horsley, from a June 2005 article, auspiciously titled “EU’s ‘enlargement blues’”.
So it’s probably Olli who got inspired by William, rather than the other way around.
“The leaders of France and Germany are trying, after the latest debacle, to show they still have joint ambitions for the “construction of Europe”.
The candidates in the EU’s waiting room must hope that their invitations are not dropped because some EU countries have other things on their minds.”
Actually, repetition is all-important in blues songwriting. The first line is repeated twice, first over the tonic section and second over the sub-dominant section. The second line is sung over the dominant section and often sums up the emotion of the first line.
A good example of this structure is found in How Many More Years, where Howlin’ Wolf sings:
“How many more years, do I have to let you dog me around,
How many more years, do I have to let you dog me around,
I’d rather be dead, sleeping well down in the ground“.
We don’t know how the Western Balkan countries feel now but 20+ years is a long time to wait.
The Roundup
Croatia was the last new country let into the EU and its prime minister today told the Strasbourg plenary that a border dispute with Slovenia needs a solution that makes both sides happy.
It was a record year for renewable energy for various reasons in 2017 but nuclear power cooperation between Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands leaves a lot to be desired. MEPs in Strasbourg also signed off on the EU’s emissions trading scheme update.
The European Investment Bank will later today reveal if it will grant its biggest ever loan to the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline. The Commission will define what ‘green investment’ actually is, in May.
Make sure you cook your chicken properly, because salmonella is back on the menu in Europe. Megafirms Bayer and Monsanto are still trying to convince EU competition queen Margrethe Vestager that their merger is above board.
A pharmaceuticals investigation in Greece threatens to throw the country’s political scene into turmoil, after a number of its ranks appear to have been implicated in it.
The Ombudsman is doing a round of the institutions this week. Maybe it’s worth looking into how transparent the Commission is with its college meetings, as publication is allegedly taking longer than it used to.
Transnational lists: good or bad idea? Check out two well-thought out opinion pieces from both sides of the argument. French MEP Alain Lamassoure told Aline Robert that it’s a crazy plan.
One man firmly in favour of the lists is former Belgian PM Guy Verhofstadt. The Hof and Juncker were caught enjoying a light-hearted moment earlier today.
Look out for…
The Parliament will decide what to do with the UK’s 73 seats once it Brexits itself into isolation.

                Overcoming a decade of enlargement fatigue, the European Commission launched its long-awaited Western Balkans strategy on Tuesday (6 February), aiming to inject new momentum into EU integration and speed up the homework the six countries need to do before joining the bloc.
“Anchoring the Balkans to a perspective of EU accession is in the interest of the EU,” High Representative Federica Mogherini said in Strasbourg, presenting the strategy to the press before a debate in Parliament.
The strategy makes it even clearer. “This firm, merit-based prospect of EU membership for the Western Balkans is in the Union’s very own political, security and economic interest. It is a geostrategic investment in a stable, strong and united Europe based on common values.”


The EU must not stop at 27 members. The Western Balkans are a part of Europe and we should give them a European perspective for the prosperity and stability of the region. I am optimistic and I believe countries like Serbia and Montenegro can join by 2025.
— EP President Tajani (@EP_President) February 6, 2018

The elephant in the room: Putin
Mogherini was not shy in responding to a question underlining that Russia clearly has an interest in the region. Others have underscored that Moscow aims to discourage the Western Balkan countries from pursuing NATO and EU membership, which is all the more reason for the EU to step up its engagement in the region.
To that end, Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, in his State of the Union” address last September, called for a “credible enlargement perspective” for the region, following the European Council decision in March to focus on the Balkans.



Without changing treaties, Juncker changes the EU
The long-awaited State of the Union address delivered by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Wednesday (13 September) has boldly set a plan for EU institutional change, without changing the Treaties.


But the growing Russian and Chinese influence in the region, which was mired in ethnic conflicts in the 1990s, following Yugoslavia’s collapse, might make it more difficult for the EU to spread its soft power.
“Corruption is rife, owing to organised crime networks that grew out of the communist-era security apparatus. The influence of the United States in the region is declining, even as Russia becomes more revanchist. And, for most of the region’s countries, a big question mark hovers over the path to European Union accession,” Guy Verhofstadt,  president of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Group (ALDE) in the European Parliament, recently said.
In many of these countries, the appetite to join the Union has also decreased. In 2017, the Balkan barometer shows that the Western Balkans’ enthusiasm has waned.
“We Europeans should be more self-confident,” Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn told a press conference. “75% of the business of the region is done with the European Union. Membership with the EU is not just economically driven but it is a commitment to the European values,” he added.
Still, progress towards membership has been slow since the 2003 EU-Western Balkans Thessaloniki Summit, when the EU declared its ‘unequivocal support’ for the region’s EU bid.
Merit-based process
Until now only Croatia did become an EU member state. For Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Kosovo, Montenegro and Serbia the path to accession has been strewn with multiple challenges that have prevented more concrete developments.
Visa-free travel is one the most tangible results of the process. All six now have stabilisation and association agreements (SAA) with the EU. Montenegro and Serbia, currently dubbed ‘frontrunners’, are negotiating multiple chapters of the EU acquis and could join the bloc in 2025 at the earliest.
Apart from the country-specific issues, experts observing the region have identified a number of trends, such as erosion of democracy, rule of law and media freedom, slack economic performance, fast-rising nationalist sentiments, and external influences, all of which require priority action.
This is why the EU executive announced six flagship initiatives to support the transformation efforts of the Western Balkans to strengthen the rule of law, cooperate on security and migration through joint investigating teams and the European Border and coast guard, to mention a few.
“They will have to act with determination. Accession is and will remain a merit-based process fully dependent on the objective progress achieved by each country,’ said Commissioner Hahn, underlining that the countries may catch up or overtake each other depending on progress made.
No tolerance for bilateral disputes
The EU, however, has put down its red lines, beyond the regular acquis [comprising its entire legislation]. There are important bilateral disputes between countries in the region which remain to be solved, reads the strategy.
Those include Serbia’s tense relations with its former province of Kosovo, which declared independence in 2008, but also the name dispute between Macedonia and Greece, as well as borders and issues stemming from the wars of the 1990s.



The Brief – How to shoot down ambitious Balkan plans
Events in the Western Balkans may indeed seem peripheral to the EU, particularly as it braces for debates on the new budget and eurozone reform, but let’s not forget the old quote by Winston Churchill: “The Balkans produce more history than they can consume.”


“We will only accept a new member state if it has resolved its conflicts with its neighbours,” Hahn continued, saying the EU will not import bilateral disputes and absorb the instability that could entail.
“Binding solutions must be found and implemented before a country accedes,” the text stressed.
Earlier on Tuesday, MEPs and the European Commission urged visiting Croatian prime minister to solve the border dispute with Slovenia.



Croatian PM urged to fast-track border dispute with Slovenia
As the EU presents its renewed Western Balkans strategy on Tuesday (6 February), Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenković was urged by the European Parliament and the Commission to find a solution to the long-standing border dispute with Slovenia.


“Short-term interests and geopolitical considerations cannot lead to exceptions to the accession criteria,” warned Liberal MEP Marietje Schaake.
“The so-called Turkey deal is an example of ambiguous EU policy towards accession countries. The Netherlands, which came up with the idea for a refugee deal with Turkey yesterday had to withdraw its ambassador to Ankara. The Commission cannot wait any longer to make it crystal clear to Erdogan that it is his autocratic policies that close Turkey’s door to Europe. Failure to do so will undermine both our credibility and influence over those countries that still want to join the EU,” Schaake added.
President Juncker  will travel to each of the countries of the Western Balkans at the end of this month with a clear message: “Keep reforming and we will keep supporting your European future.”
The diplomatic push will come in May when EU leaders will meet their six Balkan counterparts at a special enlargement summit in Sofia, as the strategy is one of the priorities of the Bulgarian presidency of the EU.
PositionsThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Bulgaria said that it ""welcomes the Strategy for the Western Balkans. A number of our ideas have found a place in it.
The document recognises the strategic importance of the region for Europe. That is why we are focusing on bringing the region back to the EU's agenda, for the first time in 15 years. For the first time after the Thessaloniki Summit in 2003, in May this year, Bulgaria will bring together all the leaders of Europe and of the region to move faster together towards our common goal.
The strategy applies to all six countries, which should accelerate reforms and build good neighbourly relations. Progress will continue to be based on the individual achievements of each individual country; no country that is ready will have to wait for another.""

                Holocaust revisionism isn’t just about rewriting history, it’s about curbing some of today’s basic democratic freedoms like the rule of law and freedom of expression, warns William Echikson.
William Echikson, a former senior policy manager at Google, heads the Centre for European Policy Studies’ Digital Forum.
A new Polish law bans the phrase “Polish death camps” – or face three years in prison. The Hungarian government honours a journalist who has referred to Jews as “stinking excrement” and described Roma as “animals” that “should not be allowed to exist.” A former Croatian Culture Minister praises the pro-Nazi Croatian Ustase movement – and questions the number of killings at the regime’s Jasenovac concentration camp.
In the wake of marking United Nations Holocaust Remembrance day on January 27 – the anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp – these are just some recent examples of a rising tide of dangerous revisionism sweeping the Holocaust’s blood-stained lands. Nationalist politicians and governments are rewriting history, rehabilitating war criminals and minimizing their nations’ participation in genocide.
The rewriting of the past carries important implications for Europe’s present. Today’s revisionism coincides with a rise of extreme nationalist and far-right political movements dedicated to rolling back democracy, the rule of law, and its modern-day beacon, the multi-ethnic, tolerant European Union.
Are we returning to the horrors of the 1930s? The  United States Holocaust Memorial Museum exhibition “State of Deception: The Power of Nazi Propaganda,” opening at the Parliamentarium Museum in Brussels on January 25, offers some alarming parallels. Full disclosure: I arranged for the exhibit to be shown in Brussels.
In the 1930s Germany, Nazi Party leaders understood the power of mass communication to disseminate hatred and anti-Semitism – and shape public opinion and behavior. They deployed sophisticated modern technologies, including radio and film, to win the battle of ideas among a well-educated population in a fledgling democracy. Importantly, the Nazis also rewrote history into a battle between the superior Aryan race and inferior Semite – with the Aryans always triumphant and the locomotive of civilization. 
Nazi-style propaganda remains all too relevant today in the very land of the Holocaust. More and more politicians are descending into xenophobic language reminiscent of the 1930s and the 1940s. In Britain’s Brexit campaign, the Leave camp unveiled a poster of contemporary Middle Eastern migrants that bore a striking resemblance to a Nazi propaganda that maligns Jews, Poles, Roma, as “parasites” who “undermin[e] their host countries.”
Often, migrants are denigrated in terms reserved in the 1930s for Jews. Jarosław
Kaczyński, head of Poland’s governing Law and Justice Party, has warned that migrants are “parasites” that carry “very dangerous diseases long absent from Europe.” In the same vein, French right wing extremist Marine Le Pen called for the “eradication of bacterial immigration,” proclaiming that immigration was causing an “alarming presence of contagious diseases” in France. In his Mein Kampf, Hitler repeatedly refers to Jews as parasites.
To be fair, some European countries have made gigantic strides in recognizing their own culpability. For decades, many French have held onto the idea that their ancestors had been either victims or resisters of Nazis, or of the collaborationist regime that was set up in Vichy. This past July, standing at a site from which thousands of French Jews were sent to their deaths during the Holocaust, President Emmanuel Macron of France deplored his nation’s wartime role in abetting murder and pledged to fight a renewed tide of anti-Semitism.
Romania represents another star student. During the war, its Army organized the deportation of Jews. In response, President Klaus Iohannis has made Holocaust training mandatory for the country’s military General Staff. Until March 2017, Romania held the chairmanship of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA), composed of 31 nations.
Unfortunately, though, history is often being forgotten or rewritten. Consider Hungary. Its government is minimizing its country’s participation in the genocide, rehabilitating war criminals, and introducing anti-Semitic writers into the national curriculum. According to Paul Shapiro of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, the truth is that Miklos Horthy’s Hungary was the first European country after World War 1 to put in place numerus clausus legislation which restricted Jewish participation in high education. Hungary passed racial laws similar to Nazi Germany in 1938 and 1939. With war came the systematic theft of Jewish property and mass murder. In 1944, Hungarian police identified and concentrated the Jews, loaded them onto trains, and delivered them into the hands of German SS units for execution at Auschwitz.
Today, Hungary’s right-wing prime minister Viktor Orban has described the arrival of asylum seekers in Europe as “a poison”, saying his country did not want or need “a single migrant”. Hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees trekked through Hungary and Austria in 2015 as they sought to reach wealthy European nations. But the flow slowed to a trickle after Orban’s government erected razor wire and fences along the southern borders last autumn and brought in tough anti-migrant laws.
The new Polish law raises similar issues. Anger is understandable when foreigners refer to Auschwitz and other extermination centers the Nazis set up in Poland as “Polish death camps.” They were Nazi death camps. Along with three million Polish Jews, at least 1.9 million Polish gentiles were killed. 
Yet many Poles were complicit in the crimes committed on their land. When a  Polish minister questions Polish participation in the murder of hundreds of their Jewish neighbours during a Holocaust-era program, he is wrong. Will the new law allow such lies to spread? Like other countries conquered by Germany, Poland too must face up to all aspects of its World War II history – without the threat of sending historians to prison. 
Perhaps it is no surprise that a Polish nationalist government is behind the new revisionist bill. 
The same government is waging an offensive on the rule of law and freedom of expression, imposing new repressive bills to control the media and attacking the independence of the country’s courts.
The threat from Holocaust Revisionism is not just about rewriting history. Above all, it is about curbing today’s democratic freedoms.
            ","Holocaust revisionism isn’t just about rewriting history, it’s about curbing some of today’s basic democratic freedoms like the rule of law and freedom of expression, warns William Echikson. William Echikson, a former senior policy manager at Google, heads the Centre for European Policy Studies’ Digital Forum. A new Polish law bans the phrase “Polish death camps” – or face three years in prison. The Hungarian government honours a journalist who has referred to Jews as “stinking excrement” and described Roma as “animals” that “should not be allowed to exist.” A former Croatian Culture Minister praises the pro-Nazi Croatian Ustase movement – and questions the number of killings at the regime’s Jasenovac concentration camp. In the wake of marking United Nations Holocaust Remembrance day on January 27 – the anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp – these are just some recent examples of a rising tide of dangerous revisionism sweeping the Holocaust’s blood-stained lands. Nationalist politicians and governments are rewriting history, rehabilitating war criminals and minimizing their nations’ participation in genocide. The rewriting of the past carries important implications for Europe’s present. Today’s revisionism coincides with a rise of extreme nationalist and far-right political movements dedicated to rolling back democracy, the rule of law, and its modern-day beacon, the multi-ethnic, tolerant European Union.

                We can’t dream of a better political arena for the next political leaders to grow up with an authentically European understanding of what’s next for all of us and the transnational lists will serve this dream, writes Alberto Alemanno.
Alberto Alemanno is Jean Monnet Professor of EU Law and – as a founder of The Good Lobby – one of the initiators of the campaign Real Representation as Europeans with WeMove.eu
Will transnational lists democratize European politics – as argued by their backers? Or rather empower the larger countries, major political parties or even populist groups – as countered by their opponents? And – should they see the light of the day – who would run, how, and who would end up being elected on those pan-EU lists?
Regardless of its outcome, today’s vote of the European Parliament – for or against transnational lists – must be rendered decipherable by first disentangling it from the ongoing, interinstitutional power play and, second, contextualising it within the broader debate about the future direction of EU democracy.
Despite voting for their representatives at the European Parliament since 1979, EU citizens do so on different dates, according to different electoral laws and support candidates selected by national – as opposed to EU – parties among their own citizens. Yet, under the Lisbon Treaty, the members of the European Parliament no longer represent ‘their’ nationals, but the ‘Union’s citizens’ and any citizen could – by virtue of the EU citizenship – run in any other country.
To move toward a more genuine EU election process, political parties should be entitled to present transnational lists. This would entail that political parties present one political manifesto and one list of candidates to all EU citizens across the territory of the whole Union so as to reflect the EU dimension. This would be in stark contrast with the current situation in which European Political Parties, being an artificial collection of national parties and their domestic bases, are only European in name. This idea has recently been revamped by Emmanuel Macron, endorsed by EU Commission President Juncker (against his own political party), and is publicly supported by Italy, Belgium and Spain. While being historically opposed to it, the UK actually gave the best occasion for this idea to come true, as it leaves 73 seats free in the European Parliament that need to be reapportioned.
The ball is in the European Parliament’s camp now, which – in the framework of the reapportionment of the UK seats – has proposed creating a pan-EU constituency for up to 46 MEPs. This would give each citizen a second vote in the election, additional to his or her traditional vote for candidates standing in national constituencies. The uncertainties surrounding Brexit (will the UK still be part of the EU by May 2019?) have been used by the European Parliament to try to put off this proposal until 2024. But today’s Parliament proposal expressly foresees that – in case the UK is still a member state of the Union at the beginning of the 2019-2014 parliamentary term -, and if there are MEPs elected on transnational lists, the latter shall take up their seats only once the UK’ withdrawal becomes effective. Although this clause raises serious doubt of constitutionality – insofar as it would enable the election of more MEPs than those foreseen by the Treaty itself -, it appears the price to be paid to create a legal basis in primary law (the 1976 Act) without changing the EU Treaties.
The ball will then go to the European Council that it is schedule to discuss it on February 23.
Why transnational lists?
According to its supporters (including myself), by breathing new life into European electoral politics, the creation of transnational lists would eventually nudge political parties to compete for ideas, votes and seats on a pan-EU scale. EU debates would not be in the hands of national, Brussels-based European politicians anymore but in all EU citizens’ ones. This would in turn energize the generally dull European Parliament electoral race and possibly stimulate a greater turn-out. By progressively setting aside the Spitzenkandidaten process – whereby EU parties select the lead candidate for the campaign -, transnational lists will pave the way to the President of the European Commission to be elected through universal suffrage. As such he (possibly a she) will no longer be the expression of a parliamentary majority and would bring it a step further the politicisation of the European public space.
Why not?
The opponents of such a reform have mounted a clear attack to transnational lists by raising the following arguments: they would detach the parliamentarians from their constituents; they would empower major countries and major political parties; they would open the door of the Parliament to more populists; and, eventually they would create first-order MEPs (those elected transnationally) as opposed to MEPs of second-order (everyone else).
When closely examined, none of these arguments seem to be well-grounded.
First, since the Lisbon Treaty, the members of the European Parliament no longer represent ‘their’ nationals, but the ‘Union’s citizens’. Moreover, the solution of pan-EU problems require a pan-EU understanding.
Second, the set-up of a pan-EU constituency would require some adjustments – as already foreseen in the French proposal pending with the Council – to avoid disparities among large and smaller countries. Yet the bottom line is that nobody should get elected from a transnational list if she will fight a exclusively national campaign.
As for political parties, it will be up to them to organize their lists so as to ensure geographic (and gender) diversity among their candidates.
Third, it appears incongruous to argue that nationalists’ parties could gain from transnational forms of engagement that appear inherently against their own nature. Yet, should it be the case, it won’t be this reform as such to generate their success.
Fourth, to overcome the suspicion of a hierarchy of MEPs, one must notice that those elected in the pan-EU constituency would enjoy the same prerogatives as all the others. Moreover, MPs elected following different methods already co-exist in different member states’ assemblies, and no one’s status has ever suffered.
The sceptics might rather feel outsmarted by elected representatives whose democratic legitimacy might appear stronger and are afraid not to be able to run on those transnational lists that will inherently favour candidates with a EU-wide appeal. Yet unfortunately this appears the most wide-spread argument currently used to justify opposition to this reform.
What would it happen in case of non-agreement? 
Failing that, political parties could still consider presenting their own candidates across several EU Member States. In the absence of a dedicated pan-European constituency and a uniform electoral procedure, parties – or emerging transnational movements, such as DIEM, CIVIO, or a EU-version of République en Marche – could register their organisations and candidates in various Member States. While extremely cumbersome – as tested by previous experiences by the Radicali and Greens in the 1990s, and Newropeans in the 2000s – this will foster the emergence of transnational lists. It is only by so doing that genuinely transnational parties will be able to convey their pan-European political message and have different nationalities appear on each transnational list. As a result, a Greek could be elected in Germany (Yanis Varoufakis?), and a Polish in Hungary or viceversa.
The Zeitgeist and pan-European elections
The European-wide constituency is already up for grab. We can’t dream of a better political arena for the next political leaders to grow up with an authentically European understanding of what’s next for all of us. In less than 24 hours, more than 50,000 European have signed up a petition asking the European Parliament and the Member States gathered in the European Council to revolutionize the next European elections by creating a pan-EU constituency open to transnational candidates.

They are an opportunity to change the way we do politics in Europe, to become more inclusive, turn under-representation into equal representation and ultimately increase the trust in our political leaders. Will European political parties accept the challenge? Luis Alvarado writes.
Luis Alvarado is the president of the European Youth Forum*.
Unsurprisingly, youth voices are already leading the way.
In a powerful and forward-thinking move, European political party youth organisations from across the political spectrum have come out strongly in support of the same goal: to create a more transparent, open and inclusive democracy. 
The path we need to take to achieve this goal by the upcoming 2019 election is so indisputable that it is supported by a joint statement of the widest possible range of youth political parties; all of whom I am proud to call members of the European Youth Forum and to represent. We are breaking the cycle of how to do ‘old-school politics’. 
So listen up and take note: 
The answer lies in the empowerment of the current and future generations of young people, to not only have their voices heard in politics but also to be fully engaged in all aspects of decision making. 
While there will be many crucial debates to come, one thing that can be universally agreed on is that for the European project to survive and thrive, young people must be at the core. This is the first pro-European generation by birth. 
A generation that knows no borders or barriers and understands that the challenges of this era can only be solved together. Migration, terrorism, inclusive and resilient societies, the future of work and the digital revolution are challenges that no nation can find solutions to on its own. 
Instead, they need to be tackled regionally and globally. Young people understand this.
It’s no secret that across Europe, young people are less likely to participate in traditional manifestations of democracy, including voting in elections. However, the ‘apathetic youth’ stereotype is a myth that has already been debunked time and time again. Young people have proven themselves to be active in society, engaged and ready to create change.
 We take action on issues that directly impact us and stand up for causes that we believe in. We saw that in the Scottish referendum and the UK general election – where young people said “enough!”. So no more excuses. 
If political parties want to be responsive to new social movements, we encourage them to work with young people: to take account of them in their manifestos, target them in their policies and put more young people forward in elections.
Let’s start with the integration of a youth perspective. Simply throwing in some statistics now and again on youth unemployment doesn’t count. Parties need to really reflect the realities of young people in Europe and to make issues facing youth a real priority. 
This means actively reaching out to young people and ensuring that young voices are meaningfully included. Placing more young candidates in electable positions, for example, has the potential to promote youth turnout and also gives voters new choices with much needed fresh perspectives and approaches. 
Political party youth organisations are united in demanding that political systems, both at the national and European level, ‘youth up’ and become much more accessible to all. There is so much potential to channel citizen engagement beyond traditional voting including the opportunities presented by digitalisation, such as e-governance and e-democracy. 
We don’t want to be only at the receiving end of strategies and actions, we want to be partners in developing them. 
We need our political leaders to think ahead: to invest in the personal and social development of young people and society. Introducing citizenship education that allows each and every young person to develop the skills and knowledge needed to become informed, responsible and critical citizens is key to safeguarding our democracy. 
The Erasmus+ programme offers amazing opportunities to contribute to the personal, social, political and economic development of youth and their communities. Imagine if all young people had the chance to experience these benefits? SPOILER ALERT: We’ve pledged to increase its budget by 10 with our #ERASMUSx10 campaign. 
The sooner Europe recognises youth as a resource for transformative change, the better. We’ve had enough of being left out of decisions that will directly impact our lives. Young people’s future has already been put at risk by short-term thinking and unsustainable solutions. 
Today’s economic and political system does not work for our planet or for people, especially young people. We need to be ambitious in implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and we need Europe to be a leader in combating climate change in Europe and globally. 
Political parties rarely come together to join forces for a common cause. However, the next European Parliament elections in 2019 have to be more than ‘politics as usual’. Youth organisations have recognised this fact and have shown themselves to be ready and willing to work towards a stronger European future together.
For political parties and candidates to write off young generations, or ignore this joint call for action, would fail not only for youth but democracy as a whole.

Political party youth organisations are united in demanding that political systems, both at the national and European level, ‘youth up’ and become much more accessible to all. There is so much potential to channel citizen engagement beyond traditional voting including the opportunities presented by digitalisation, such as e-governance and e-democracy. We don’t want to be only at the receiving end of strategies and actions, we want to be partners in developing them. We need our political leaders to think ahead: to invest in the personal and social development of young people and society. Introducing citizenship education that allows each and every young person to develop the skills and knowledge needed to become informed, responsible and critical citizens is key to safeguarding our democracy. The Erasmus+ programme offers amazing opportunities to contribute to the personal, social, political and economic development of youth and their communities. Imagine if all young people had the chance to experience these benefits? SPOILER ALERT: We’ve pledged to increase its budget by 10 with our #ERASMUSx10 campaign. The sooner Europe recognises youth as a resource for transformative change, the better. We’ve had enough of being left out of decisions that will directly impact our lives. Young people’s future has already been put at risk by short-term thinking and unsustainable solutions. Today’s economic and political system does not work for our planet or for people, especially young people. We need to be ambitious in implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and we need Europe to be a leader in combating climate change in Europe and globally. Political parties rarely come together to join forces for a common cause. However, the next European Parliament elections in 2019 have to be more than ‘politics as usual’. Youth organisations have recognised this fact and have shown themselves to be ready and willing to work towards a stronger European future together. For political parties and candidates to write off young generations, or ignore this joint call for action, would fail not only for youth but democracy as a whole. *The op-ed was endorsed by European Liberal Youth (LYMEC), Federation of Young European Greens (FYEG), Young Democrats for Europe (YDE), Young European Federalists (JEF), European Democrat Students (EDS), International Federation of Liberal Youth (IFLRY), European Free Alliance Youth (EFAy), Youth of the European People’s Party (YEPP), Young European Socialists (YES) and International Union of Socialist Youth (IUSY).",57

                Transnational lists are a good idea to strengthen democracy at a European level but a closer look at it reveals “a bad good idea”. Steven Van Hecke and Wouter Wolfs voice their three main reservations on the subject.
Steven Van Hecke is associate professor in Comparative and EU Politics at the University of Leuven. Wouter Wolfs is a junior research fellow at the Public Governance Institute of the University of Leuven.
“A bad good idea”, as Jean-Luc Dehaene (1940-2014) – former Belgian prime minister and vice-chairman of the European Convention  – described the Spitzenkandidaten process. The idea to directly link the choice for Commission president to the results of the European elections was not new, but was implemented for the first time in 2014.
Although not without its flaws, this system of lead candidates worked, so Dehaene was proven wrong. It even set the stage for the future European elections.
For the 2019 elections another electoral novelty is proposed: European transnational lists. The introduction of an EU-wide constituency in which a number of MEPs are elected on transnational lists can strengthen the democratic and European dimension of the elections and put an end to its “secondary order” character.
The Spitzenkandidaten system could also benefit from it. Politically, it would no longer be acceptable to be a candidate for Commission president without standing for election, as was the case with Jean-Claude Juncker in 2014. In other words, the lead candidates from the different political families would head the transnational lists and hold real European-wide electoral campaigns, trying to appeal voters from 27 member states, not only those from their own member state.
On the other hand, transnational lists could also undermine the legitimacy of a future Commission president. Imagine that the lead candidate with the support of the largest political group in the European Parliament is not the Spitzenkandidat with the most preference votes.
Therefore, at first sight, a pan-European constituency with transnational lists is a good idea, at least to everyone who believes in strengthening democracy at European level. However, on closer examination, it indeed turns out to be – in the words of Dehaene – a “bad good idea”.
Aside from the fact that it could create a rift between first-tier and second-tier legislators in the European Parliament, we hold three main reservations.
Comparative political science provides our first counterargument. An electoral district that spans the entire territory of the country does not exist in traditional federal states like Germany or the US, nor in large countries like Russia, Brazil or India. At least it does not exist for parliamentary elections, and not without good reasons.
The core function of members of parliament lies in representing and interacting with their voters. The European Parliament has even adjusted its calendar for this reason. Every month, its members return to their own electoral district to stay in touch with their electoral base. Such frequent contacts are, however, not expected from members of the government. The executive should first of all govern and if they represent, they always represent the entire country, not an individual constituency.
Therefore, the executive is sometimes elected in a country-wide district, like the president of France. Along the same lines, if an EU-wide constituency would be introduced, it would make more sense to use it to directly elect the European Commission president rather than a number of MEPs. After all, and according to its current President, the Commission is the EU’s political body par excellence that represents the common interest of the Union.
Our second reservation relates to the way the European elections are currently organized. Instead of one European election, it is be more appropriate to talk about a “sum” of 28 national elections. Except for a number of general guidelines, the differences between the member states in electing their MEPs are significant. An Italian for example can only be a candidate in the European elections from the age of 25, whereas in Belgium the threshold lies at 21 and in the Netherlands at 18.
Some member states allow preferential voting, whereas others, as Germany, use a closed-list system. Some member states have put in place an electoral threshold, like Romania, and others have no threshold. Not to mention the plethora of different campaign finance rules across the various European countries.
These differences are already unacceptable, because they all concern the elections of the same parliament. The introduction of a pan-European constituency would only aggravate this problem. So as long as the member states shy away from harmonizing their electoral rules, the use of one electoral district with transnational lists is not at all desirable.
Third, a pan-European district could shift the balance more in favour of the larger EU member states, because it is easier for a candidate from those countries to maximize his or her number of votes. Indeed, an important question remains how to avoid that, for example, only German or French candidates are elected on the transnational lists, simply because they come from larger countries.
There are several solutions for this, but the most straightforward is to determine how many transnational seats can be won by candidates from each of the member states. For instance, German candidates would only be able to win 5 out of 27 seats on the transnational lists. This would result in a competition in each member state for “their” transnational seat(s) … which is basically similar to the way the European elections are currently fought. Consequently, the attempt to make the elections more “European” through transnational lists would be in vain.
In sum, the introduction of an EU-wide constituency for the election of a number of MEPs would be far from perfect. It is, therefore, not surprising that several heads of government and political groups in the European Parliament have been rather critical about the idea.
At the same time, this makes it also very unlikely that transnational lists will be used in the 2019 European elections, since all EU national governments must agree, whereas so far they have not even succeeded in developing common rules for the current European elections. Until that problem is solved and because of the other reasons mentioned, Dehaene might be right: transnational lists are a bad good idea.

                MEPs are ready to pick a fight with EU leaders and reject any candidate for EU Commission president who is not voted for by the European electorate after a transparent and open process, like in the 2014 elections.
In a vote on Wednesday (7 February), the European Parliament voted in favour of a resolution that rejects any back-door deals among EU leaders on who to choose to lead the EU executive.
“President Macron, if you really want to strengthen European democracy, you should support the principle of Spitzenkandidaten,” said Manfred Weber, the head of the centre-right European People’s Party, which picked President Jean-Claude Juncker in the last elections.
“A candidate and a programme. At every election at local, regional and national levels, the same basic democratic principle applies: people vote for a candidate and for a programme … With the Spitzenkandidaten process, we simply want this to be applied at the European level as well,” Weber continued.

Under the system, each political group in the Parliament nominates a candidate for the role. The European Council then makes the final choice, “taking account” of the Parliament’s nomination, in the vaguely worded provision of the EU’s treaties. The whole Assembly gets a vote at the end.
EU leaders, who will discuss the issue at a Brussels summit on 23 February, oppose what they view as a stitch-up by MEPs that robs countries of their power to pick who will fill one of the continent’s most influential roles.



Summit to set rules in race to succeed Juncker
The race to succeed Jean-Claude Juncker as head of the first post-Brexit European Commission begins later this month – and in typical EU style it is starting with a row about how the race should be run.


The French president and other leaders in the Council, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, are still at odds with the Spitzenkandidat system.
Juncker, chosen as a Spitzenkandidat in 2014, addressed MEPs on Tuesday (6 February) and sent a clear message to EU leaders, asking them to stand by this “tiny piece of democratic progress” and warning against creating a conflict between Parliament and the Council.
“We have to be sure we can bring about the success in 2019, ensure that we wrap things up for 2019,” he said. “We need to be standing by our Spitzenkandidaten system: It is about the democratic fabric of the EU.”
At stake, however, is not just a power struggle between national leaders and the European Parliament over who gets to choose Juncker’s successor, but fears that a lack of democratic process could give fresh ammunition to Eurosceptics.
Critics say the system has politicised the Commission and this only boosts concerns about diminishing national sovereignty versus Brussels, played up by Eurosceptics.
MEPs, however, insist that the system countered growing Euroscepticism by showing the EU at its most democratic, since it directly involves the Parliament, the Union’s only directly elected institution.
Another fear is that if Eurosceptic groups win the next European elections in May 2019, they could pick an outlier candidate, like France’s Marine Le Pen or Greek former Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, and the EU leaders could then be obliged to back them.
Speaking after the vote, former MEP Andrew Duff said the decision not to back the transnational lists risks diminishing the European Parliament’s legitimacy.
“It will certainly call into question the continuation of the Spitzenkandidaten experiment which, one recalls, we introduced in 2014 to compensate for the failure at that stage to introduce transnational lists,” he added.

Now that transnational lists are once again moribund, the Spitzenkandidaten system is here to stay.

“We are pleased to have secured the continuation of the Spitzenkandidaten process, which will help give the forthcoming elections at least some European focus. It is regrettable that this is the maximum that could be conceded by elected representatives whose pro-European credentials are called into question by their timid and unambitious approach,” lamented Green MEP Philippe Lambert after the vote.
While the EU’s French Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier is the rumoured early EPP front-runner to take charge of the bloc’s executive arm in 2019, Macron has promised a “real campaign” for the European elections.
But the procedure of choosing a group leader, or Spitzenkandidat, forces political parties to find an agreement on who to nominate months in advance.
In 2019, ALDE’s president Guy Verhofstadt could once again run for the liberals. The decision will have to be taken by the end of the year. But for the moment, Macron’s Republique en Marche (REM) party does not reject the option of presenting its own candidate “against Verhofstadt”.

In the report adopted on Wednesday, MEPs also approved proposed changes to the Framework Agreement on relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission by 457 votes to 200, with 20 abstentions.
The proposed changes will allow serving Commissioners to run in elections for the European Parliament and to be designated by European political parties as Spitzenkandidaten to become Commission President, without first having to take an unpaid leave of absence.

                A European Commission decision on Wednesday (7 February) to approve state aid for emergency power plants – often gas or coal-fired – has been accused of complicating ongoing negotiations in the European Parliament.
Emergency power schemes in six member states are now eligible for public money, according to an announcement by the Commission’s powerful competition directorate.
In Belgium and Germany, the Commission has authorised temporary strategic reserves, mainly related to the ageing nuclear fleet and phase out from atomic power.
In the cases of Italy and Poland, the Commission has authorised market-wide capacity mechanisms, which are more controversial because they open the door to subsidies for gas or coal-fired power plants, which are used as back up for renewables.
“Capacity mechanisms can help to safeguard security of electricity supply, but they must be designed so as to avoid distortions of competition in energy markets,” said Margrethe Vestager, the Danish Commissioner in charge of competition policy.
In a statement, she described the approved capacity mechanisms as “well-designed”,  saying they “will foster competition among all potential capacity providers to the benefit of consumers and our European energy market.”
Fierce debate
But the decision has stoked up an already fierce debate about whether these so-called capacity mechanisms are compatible with the EU’s climate and clean energy goals.
Depending on the outcome of ongoing talks in the European Parliament to overhaul the EU’s electricity market design, big polluters could be funded by public money well beyond 2030.
Green lawmaker Claude Turmes called today’s decision “totally unacceptable” and accused the Commission of “undermining democracy” by allowing EU capitals to continue to subsidise coal power plants, just as MEPs come to the sharp end of negotiating rules for the next decade.



EU plan to cap fossil fuel subsidies will stymie renewables, power utilities warn
A European Commission proposal aimed at capping fossil fuel subsidies across the EU could have perverse effects by promoting investment in new gas-fired fossil fuel power instead of renewable energies, according to a new study.


Capacity mechanisms are measures taken by national governments to guarantee security of supply as back up for intermittent renewable power.
But due to the length of contracts awarded, particularly in coal-dependent Poland where new mechanisms are approved for 15 years, the decision has been labelled as “inconsistent” with the Paris Agreement targets by green campaigners.
According to think tank WiseEuropa, approving Poland’s capacity market means Polish citizens could fork out €6 billion over the next decade to pay for the scheme.
The Polish case is particularly controversial as it allows existing power plants to be included, rather than purely new capacity. That means that one of the country’s most polluting coal-fired plants at Kozienice will be eligible for temporary subsidies, despite already being online.
Although the Commission stipulated that the capacity mechanisms approved today will have to comply with future EU laws, it means that they will be classed as existing schemes and will be allowed to operate with subsidies longer, unless member states back down from their current negotiating position
How to incorporate capacity mechanisms into the EU’s electricity market is one of the main sticking points of ongoing talks, as they are in essence market distorting tools.



EU still divided over curbing power subsidies with CO2 cap
A European Commission proposal to put an emissions limit on what power plants can be subsidised continues to divide the member states but the EU executive and the European Parliament stand united in supporting the CO2 cap.


Emissions cap
The Commission’s 2016 proposal suggested an emissions limit, precluding any capacity scheme that exceeds 550g of CO2 per kilowatt hour from public money grants.
A number of influential policymakers, including EU Climate Commissioner Miguel Arias Cañete and Claude Turmes, have personally backed the 550g Emissions Performance Standard (EPS) and now the debate is more focused on timeframe rather than the criteria itself.
During a December meeting, the EU’s 28 energy ministers agreed an implementation date of 2025 for new plants and 2030 for existing infrastructure. But a number of vague sentences and loopholes in the final text drew the ire of environmental groups.



EU ministers stumble towards joint position on future energy laws
Energy ministers on Monday (18 December) took well over 15 hours to agree common positions on four clean energy draft pieces of EU legislation ahead of a final round of talks in 2018 with the European Parliament and Commission.


ClientEarth energy lawyer Sam Bright said that it was “shrewd” that future rules will apply to these new capacity schemes but urged the Commission to “make serious changes” to its guidelines on approving energy subsidies.
Ministers also added a second ingredient to the EPS mix, stipulating that the 550g CO2 limit could be supplemented by a provision of “700kg of CO2 per installed kW per year”. The lack of clarity in the wording has been criticised as it could mean that the biggest polluting plants would remain subsidised if they fulfil one of the criteria only.
There is also the matter of who decides what actually is a capacity mechanism. Currently, national authorities decide on a case-by-case basis, which competition boss Vestager described as “well-designed” schemes.
However, under draft rules, those assessments will have to be carried out at EU level after 2020.
Next steps
Now the ball is firmly in the European Parliament’s court and the shadow rapporteurs on the file will meet later today to hammer out compromise amendments to draft the Parliament position on the electricity market design directive.
A vote in the energy committee is set for 21 February and MEPs will now be under pressure to ensure the new rules indeed apply to existing infrastructure.
But the Parliament’s quest to find a compromise that pleases all political groups looks doomed to failure as there are simply too many diverging positions.
The Socialists, Greens and leftists (GUE) all want to strengthen the Commission’s proposal, in contrast to the Conservative ECR group and the rapporteur himself, Latvian lawmaker Krišjānis Kariņš (European People’s Party).
Sources familiar with the file predict that MEPs will ultimately agree to support the 550g plan but will water it down by adopting a similar “kick the can down the road” strategy that energy ministers did in December.
This means the wishes of environmental groups like Greenpeace, which even advocates for a much tougher 350g cap, are unlikely to come to fruition, particularly when the Parliament goes to three-way talks with the Commission and member states later this year.



Political intrigue casts shadow over EU's latest Energy Council
When EU ministers gathered in Brussels on Monday (18 December) to hammer out an agreement over a set of clean energy laws, the elephant in the room was a proposal from the European Commission to cap subsidies going to coal-fired power plants.


PositionsThe Make Power Clean Campaign, an alliance of energy firms and trade associations in favour of the 550g criterion, said: ""we don’t take a stance on CRMs per se. What we say is that, if they are being used, they should not be a mechanism to give public funds to the dirtiest power generation, and therefore should respect the 550 threshold. The reform should apply to existing plants as soon as possible to include the 550g threshold.""
Joanna Flisowska, Coal Policy Coordinator at Climate Action Network (CAN) Europe, said: “The Commission’s green light to an unprecedented amount of coal subsidies is obviously inconsistent with the imperative to phase out coal in Europe by 2030 required by the objectives of the Paris Agreement. It is a huge sell-out to the Polish coal industry at the expense of Polish taxpayers and the climate. It is vitally important that the EU corrects this mistake and ensures that the biggest polluters are precluded from receiving public money in the ongoing negotiations of the Clean Energy Package.The only silver lining is that the Commission has recognized that the scheme can only be applied temporarily and will have to be adjusted in light of the outcomes of these negotiations.”

            ","A European Commission decision on Wednesday (7 February) to approve state aid for emergency power plants – often gas or coal-fired – has been accused of complicating ongoing negotiations in the European Parliament. Emergency power schemes in six member states are now eligible for public money, according to an announcement by the Commission’s powerful competition directorate. In Belgium and Germany, the Commission has authorised temporary strategic reserves, mainly related to the ageing nuclear fleet and phase out from atomic power. In the cases of Italy and Poland, the Commission has authorised market-wide capacity mechanisms, which are more controversial because they open the door to subsidies for gas or coal-fired power plants, which are used as back up for renewables. “Capacity mechanisms can help to safeguard security of electricity supply, but they must be designed so as to avoid distortions of competition in energy markets,” said Margrethe Vestager, the Danish Commissioner in charge of competition policy. In a statement, she described the approved capacity mechanisms as “well-designed”, saying they “will foster competition among all potential capacity providers to the benefit of consumers and our European energy market.” Fierce debate But the decision has stoked up an already fierce debate about whether these so-called capacity mechanisms are compatible with the EU’s climate and clean energy goals. Depending on the outcome of ongoing talks in the European Parliament to overhaul the EU’s electricity market design, big polluters could be funded by public money well beyond 2030. Green lawmaker Claude Turmes called today’s decision “totally unacceptable” and accused the Commission of “undermining democracy” by allowing EU capitals to continue to subsidise coal power plants, just as MEPs come to the sharp end of negotiating rules for the next decade. EU plan to cap fossil fuel subsidies will stymie renewables, power utilities warn A European Commission proposal aimed at capping fossil fuel subsidies across the EU could have perverse effects by promoting investment in new gas-fired fossil fuel power instead of renewable energies, according to a new study. Capacity mechanisms are measures taken by national governments to guarantee security of supply as back up for intermittent renewable power. But due to the length of contracts awarded, particularly in coal-dependent Poland where new mechanisms are approved for 15 years, the decision has been labelled as “inconsistent” with the Paris Agreement targets by green campaigners. According to think tank WiseEuropa, approving Poland’s capacity market means Polish citizens could fork out €6 billion over the next decade to pay for the scheme. The Polish case is particularly controversial as it allows existing power plants to be included, rather than purely new capacity. That means that one of the country’s most polluting coal-fired plants at Kozienice will be eligible for temporary subsidies, despite already being online. Although the Commission stipulated that the capacity mechanisms approved today will have to comply with future EU laws, it means that they will be classed as existing schemes and will be allowed to operate with subsidies longer, unless member states back down from their current negotiating position How to incorporate capacity mechanisms into the EU’s electricity market is one of the main sticking points of ongoing talks, as they are in essence market distorting tools. EU still divided over curbing power subsidies with CO2 cap A European Commission proposal to put an emissions limit on what power plants can be subsidised continues to divide the member states but the EU executive and the European Parliament stand united in supporting the CO2 cap. Emissions cap The Commission’s 2016 proposal suggested an emissions limit, precluding any capacity scheme that exceeds 550g of CO2 per kilowatt hour from public money grants. A number of influential policymakers, including EU Climate Commissioner Miguel Arias Cañete and Claude Turmes, have personally backed the 550g Emissions Performance Standard (EPS) and now the debate is more focused on timeframe rather than the criteria itself. During a December meeting, the EU’s 28 energy ministers agreed an implementation date of 2025 for new plants and 2030 for existing infrastructure. But a number of vague sentences and loopholes in the final text drew the ire of environmental groups. EU ministers stumble towards joint position on future energy laws Energy ministers on Monday (18 December) took well over 15 hours to agree common positions on four clean energy draft pieces of EU legislation ahead of a final round of talks in 2018 with the European Parliament and Commission. ClientEarth energy lawyer Sam Bright said that it was “shrewd” that future rules will apply to these new capacity schemes but urged the Commission to “make serious changes” to its guidelines on approving energy subsidies. Ministers also added a second ingredient to the EPS mix, stipulating that the 550g CO2 limit could be supplemented by a provision of “700kg of CO2 per installed kW per year”. The lack of clarity in the wording has been criticised as it could mean that the biggest polluting plants would remain subsidised if they fulfil one of the criteria only. There is also the matter of who decides what actually is a capacity mechanism. Currently, national authorities decide on a case-by-case basis, which competition boss Vestager described as “well-designed” schemes. However, under draft rules, those assessments will have to be carried out at EU level after 2020. Next steps Now the ball is firmly in the European Parliament’s court and the shadow rapporteurs on the file will meet later today to hammer out compromise amendments to draft the Parliament position on the electricity market design directive. A vote in the energy committee is set for 21 February and MEPs will now be under pressure to ensure the new rules indeed apply to existing infrastructure. But the Parliament’s quest to find a compromise that pleases all political groups looks doomed to failure as there are simply too many diverging positions. The Socialists, Greens and leftists (GUE) all want to strengthen the Commission’s proposal, in contrast to the Conservative ECR group and the rapporteur himself, Latvian lawmaker Krišjānis Kariņš (European People’s Party). Sources familiar with the file predict that MEPs will ultimately agree to support the 550g plan but will water it down by adopting a similar “kick the can down the road” strategy that energy ministers did in December. This means the wishes of environmental groups like Greenpeace, which even advocates for a much tougher 350g cap, are unlikely to come to fruition, particularly when the Parliament goes to three-way talks with the Commission and member states later this year. Political intrigue casts shadow over EU's latest Energy Council When EU ministers gathered in Brussels on Monday (18 December) to hammer out an agreement over a set of clean energy laws, the elephant in the room was a proposal from the European Commission to cap subsidies going to coal-fired power plants. PositionsThe Make Power Clean Campaign, an alliance of energy firms and trade associations in favour of the 550g criterion, said: ""we don’t take a stance on CRMs per se. What we say is that, if they are being used, they should not be a mechanism to give public funds to the dirtiest power generation, and therefore should respect the 550 threshold. The reform should apply to existing plants as soon as possible to include the 550g threshold."" Joanna Flisowska, Coal Policy Coordinator at Climate Action Network (CAN) Europe, said: “The Commission’s green light to an unprecedented amount of coal subsidies is obviously inconsistent with the imperative to phase out coal in Europe by 2030 required by the objectives of the Paris Agreement.

                Procedural problems prevented Romanian Justice Minister Tudorel Toader from addressing the European Parliament’s plenary session on Wednesday (7 February) and explaining the government’s current judiciary reforms, which many MEPs see as a threat to the rule of law.
Instead, MEPs grilled Romania’s government ‘in absentia’ on Wednesday, although Toader was present in Strasbourg and ready to speak.
Roberta Metsola, a spokeswoman on home affairs and civil liberties for the centre-right European People’s Party (EPP), explained that the Romanian justice minister could not take the floor in the plenary because this is a privilege reserved for prime ministers.
For “reasons of her own”, the new Prime Minster Viorica Dăncilă, who is a former MEP, could not attend, Metsola said.



Romania’s backbencher MEP Viorica Dăncilă to be Prime Minister
Romania’s ruling Social Democrats on Tuesday (16 January) put forward European Parliament lawmaker Viorica Dăncilă to become prime minister, after power struggles within the party forced out the second premier in seven months.


That prompted Romanian MEP Dan Nica of the Socialists and Democrats (S&D) group to argue that according to the Romanian Constitution, it wasn’t the prime minister but the president of Romania who should have been in Brussels, and in his absence, the minister of justice.
“The Romanian justice minister is here, and I think that for this kind of debate, to hear all the arguments, it is necessary to hear minister Tudorel Toader, who is also a member of the Venice Commission, so that he would answer the questions.”
“I think it’s a very grave thing, we are discussing important issues today and it’s important for democracy, for all Romanians, that here, in the European Parliament, the Romanian justice minister should be able to give his explanations”, Nica said, appealing to the President to give Toader the possibility to speak.
Cristian Preda of the EPP retorted that Prime Minister Dăncilă was afraid to come to speak in Strasbourg.
In the end, the debate took place without the minister. Toader arrived in Strasbourg on Monday and had meetings with the Commission’s First Vice President in charge of rule of law, Frans Timmermans, and with members of the S&D group.
Justice Commissioner Věra Jourová made a harsh assessment of the situation in Romania, repeating the concerns recently voiced by Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and his right-hand man Timmermans, who is the most senior social democrat in the EU executive.



EU warns it may not lift Romania monitoring
The EU on Wednesday (24 January) voiced “concern” at Romania’s controversial plans for judicial reform, warning against “backtracking” on efforts to fight corruption, in the latest clash between Brussels and the bloc’s former communist east.


She said there was widespread opposition to the changes to Romanian law and that this was also illustrated by the massive protests staged by Romanian citizens.
“The Commission has made no secret of the fact that it shares these concerns. So does the Council of Europe anti-corruption watchdog, which for the first time has decided to launch its own inquiry, with a report due in March”, she said.
Jourová said the Commission was seeing “open criticism of the judiciary defiance of judicial decisions” of the Romanian government vis-à-vis the judiciary, which “do not inspire confidence in the process”.
“The Council of Europe’s principle is that you cannot reform the judicial system against the judiciary,” she said, advising the Romanian authorities to consult with the Council of Europe Venice Commission before the new laws are promulgated.
The debate which followed descended into a series of heated exchanges between Romanian S&D and ALDE MEPs, who are supportive of the government, and their compatriots from EPP in the European Parliament. Few new arguments were heard.
Several Romanian S&D MEPs spoke of links between the judiciary and the “secret services”, alluding that the Romanian anti-corruption body has become an instrument for political repression against the PSD.



Romania’s anti-corruption services are reminiscent of Securitate
SRI, Romania’s domestic intelligence service, is evolving into what many regard as the Securitate Version 2.0, a reference to Nicolae Ceaușescu’s feared security service, writes Nick Kochan.


S&D Vice President Tanja Fajon voiced support for the authorities in Bucharest, stating that they had “openly and clearly shown their sincere willingness to explain the ongoing judicial reforms and to address the pending issues in accordance with European standards”.
“Hence, we firmly reject any politicisation or calculated attacks launched by the EPP. In Europe, there is no ‘Romanian issue’. The EPP and the right-wing forces should better look at Hungary and Poland, whose governments are deeply, concretely and continuously putting in danger their democracy and rule of law”, Fajon stated.
From the EPP, Malta’s Roberta Metsola highlighted the protests by Romanian citizens.
“Romanian citizens want a country where the rule of law and courts function, where corruption is fought and not condoned and where politicians work for the common good, not narrow personal interests. This is why they have been on the streets for more than a year. In freezing temperatures and snow, they flew EU flags because they believed in the values of Europe. The EU must not forget them. We must send them a clear message: you embody all that is right about Europe and we will not ignore you. The EPP Group will not ignore you”, Metsola stated.
Ska Keller, co-president of the Greens/EFA Group, criticised the Romanian government and also commended the citizens for their civic actions. She said, however, that it was high time that Romania is given the right join the passport-free Schengen area.
“We cannot accept that Romanian citizens are still unable to enjoy the same freedom to travel as the people of the Schengen area”, Keller said.
Bulgaria’s deputy minister Monika Panayotova, representing the Council, was very careful not to make judgements, and her position was praised by Romanian S&D MEPs. Both Romania and Bulgaria are under the so-called “Cooperation and Verification mechanism”, a unique monitoring procedure launched because of the perceived deficiencies in their law-enforcement systems.

Moving from Berlin to Strasbourg: it’s plenary week and the big focus was on transnational lists freeing MEPs from the chains of national boundaries to be selected or rejected by voters from across Europe.


🇪🇺This week, the European Parliament is going to vote on a proposal to create a EU-wide constituency for European elections #EP2019💡We have long advocated for this idea – here are the main reasons for transnational lists: https://t.co/SvriMi4f9C #transnationallist #EPlenary pic.twitter.com/5LrJS2Rs6A

So would they or wouldn’t they go for it? Spoiler alert! They didn’t.
The European People’s Party spearheaded the parliament’s vote against the initiative.


Good news for the democratic accountability of the @Europarl_EN. The #EPPGroup managed to defeat the #TransnationalLists for the next EP elections.

Sam Ryan pointed out that last month Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he supported transnational lists, but this week his party voted against them.

                The European Union and Azerbaijan today (9 February) held their 15th Cooperation Council, a high point in relations intended to be held annually, after a three year gap. .
As the official press release says, the meeting took place in the context of an intensification of EU-Azerbaijan relations, including the launch of negotiations last year on a new bilateral agreement.
The previous Cooperation Council took place in November 2013, but relations between Baku and Brussels hit a low in 2015, following European Parliament resolutions that were highly critical of the human rights situation and the prosecution of human rights defenders in Azerbaijan.
For its part, the Commission has been more business-minded and in November 2016 adopted a mandate to negotiate a new agreement with Baku, which would replace the 1996 partnership and cooperation agreement.



EU to launch negotiations for a new agreement with Azerbaijan
EU foreign ministers decided today (14 November) to start negotiating a comprehensive agreement with Azerbaijan, replacing the Association agreement proposed in 2010, which had omitted to take into account Baku’s view about the future of relations.


The EU had planned to pursue a policy of association with its East European neighbours, until setbacks such as the Ukraine crisis and the decision of Armenia and Belarus to join the Russia-led Customs Union prompted a rethinking of the strategy.
Out of the six countries members of the Eastern Partnership (EaP), only Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine stick to their Association Agreements.
The case of Azerbaijan seems to be different, as the energy-rich country wants to pursue a policy that makes them equally independent from Russia and the EU and to have a relationship similar to the one Brussels maintains with South Korea and Australia.
Today’s Council was chaired by EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini, with the Azerbaijani delegation led by Foreign Affairs minister Elmar Mammadyarov.
From their statements it became clear that the importance of accelerating Azerbaijan’s accession to the WTO was discussed, as this would allow the negotiators to envisage a more ambitious trade chapter in the new bilateral agreement.
The meeting had been very open and very useful, said Mogherini. She added that the EU supported Azerbaijan’s territorial integrity and mentioned the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, a post-Soviet frozen conflict as a result of which Azeri territory has been occupied since 1994, and because of which Azerbaijan and Armenia are still technically at war. She said the conflict continued to represent a very serious challenge. The resumption of high-level dialogue in Vienna, St. Petersburg and Geneva was an important development, she said, urging the parties to intensify negotiations.
“The status quo is not sustainable and the conflict needs a political solution”, she said.
She also mentioned the Southern Gas Corridor as an example of the EU-Azerbaijan strategic partnership in the field of energy.
Mogherini said that she addressed democracy, rule of law and respect for human rights with her Azerbaijani counterparts, but didn’t mention concrete cases of concern for the EU.

— European External Action Service – EEAS 🇪🇺 (@eu_eeas) February 9, 2018

Mammadyarov said the visit of the President of Azerbaijan Ilham Alyiev to Brussels in February 2017 had opened a new chapter in his country’s relations with the EU. He said the sides had a very intense exchange on regional and security issues, which he said his country considered of benefit also for the EU. He said he briefed Mogherini on the latest talks on Nagorno-Karabakh and urged for a solution in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the United Nations Security Council.
The minister said that a meeting would take place on the Southern Gas Corridor (SGC) on 15 February. He said that this year the Trans-Anatolian pipeline, the Turkish leg of SGC, will be inaugurated and start bringing Azeri gas to Turkey. Similarly, he expressed confidence that through the Trans Adriatic Pipeline (TAP), which is the European leg of SGC, to Italy, would be ready from 2020, and welcomed the decision of the European Investment Bank to provide a €1.5 billion loan for the TAP.



EU bank approves largest ever energy loan, for TAP pipeline
The European Investment Bank on Tuesday (6 February) approved its largest ever single loan to an energy project: the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP). The €1.5 billion grant will be used to bring gas from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean.


Mammadyarov urged for more cooperation in the transport sector, highlighting the recent launch of the rail link Baku-Tbilisi-Kars.



Azerbaijan, Georgia, Turkey launch 'Silk Road' rail link
The leaders of Azerbaijan, Turkey and Georgia launched an 826-km rail link connecting the three countries on 30 October, establishing a freight and passenger link between Europe and China that bypasses Russia.


No questions allowed
Neither Mogherini or Mammadyarov field questions, but an envoy from the Georgian television Rustavi2 succeeded in collaring the Azeri minister in the corridor to demand a comment on the sentencing of Azerbaijani journalist Afghan Mukhtarli to six years in prison after he had investigated high-level corruption.



EU concerned by sentencing of journalist in Azerbaijan
The EU expressed concern on Sunday (14 January) over the sentencing of Azerbaijani journalist Afghan Mukhtarli to six years in prison after he had investigated high-level corruption.


Mukhtarli, 43, had lived in self-imposed exile in neighbouring Georgia since 2015 after investigating Azerbaijan’s strongman leader Ilham Aliyev for corruption.
Human Rights Watch reported Mukhtarli had been kidnapped in the Georgian capital in May 2017 and brought back to Azerbaijan, where he was placed in police custody. Mukhtarli himself said he had been abducted by plain-clothed men who spoke Georgian.
Days ago Mukhtarli was released for 48 hours to attend the funeral of a family member, using the opportunity to tell Rustavi2 that he was the victim of the interests of Aliyev and of his business partner, Bidzina Ivanishvili in Georgia. Ivanishvili is no longer Prime Minister, but is perceived as the country’s strongman.
Asked to comment, Mammadyarov said that judicial authorities were in charge, and if there would be an appeal, a court would return to the case.
“Everything will be done according to law”, he said.
Asked by the journalist how he would comment a resolution of the European Parliament on Kuktarli’s case adopted on 15 July, he remarked that “I leave this to the conscience of the Parliament”.

                The European Union on Monday (13 February) called on Turkey to avoid threats and “refrain from any actions that might damage good neighbourly” ties after Cyprus accused the Turkish military of obstructing a ship exploring for gas.
Cyprus said on Sunday the Turkish military had obstructed a vessel contracted by Italian oil company ENI which was approaching an area to explore for natural gas.
Greek Cypriots run Cyprus’s internationally recognised government, while Turkish Cypriots have a breakaway state in the north – recognised only by Ankara – and say resources around the island belong to them too.
After speaking to the Cyprus President Nicos Anastasiades, European Council President Donald Tusk urged Turkey to “avoid threats or actions against any EU member and instead commit to good neighbourly relations, peaceful dispute settlement and respect for territorial sovereignty.”
Turkey’s foreign ministry made no mention of the ENI ship in a statement on Sunday, but said the case was a unilateral move by Greek Cypriots that violated the sovereign rights of Turkish Cypriots.
It said the Greek Cypriots were jeopardising security and stability on the island and in the region.



Cyprus, Turkey spar after warships block gas drilling ship
Cyprus yesterday (11 February) insisted Turkey had breached “international law” after Ankara’s warships blocked an Italian drilling ship on course to explore for gas in the island’s politically sensitive waters.


A spokeswoman for the European Commission echoed Tusks’s line, telling journalists on Monday that “Turkey needs to commit unequivocally to neighbourly relations and avoid any kind of source of friction, threat or action directed against a member state.”
“The EU also stresses the need to respect the sovereignty of member states over their territorial sea and airspace,” she added.
On Monday Greece accused Turkey of violating international law and said its “provocative conduct” was inconsistent with that of a country seeking accession to the EU.
“We call on Turkey to desist from further unlawful actions and to comply with its obligations stemming from international law,” the foreign ministry in Athens said in a statement.



Greece-Turkey tensions mount over plan to start Cyprus gas drilling
As Cyprus prepares to start offshore drilling for gas in its economic zone, Turkey announced it was readying “countermeasures” and Greece replied it was “ready to defend its sovereign rights”, in a clear sign of growing tensions between the two NATO members.


Relations between the EU and Turkey have become strained by disagreements over democracy and human rights, especially since a large-scale crackdown in the wake of a failed Turkish coup in 2016.
However, European countries still rely on Turkey as a NATO ally and as a brake to help reduce an influx of Syrian and other migrants and refugees into the bloc.
Turkey’s EU minister, Omer Celik, will join 28 foreign ministers of the bloc for talks in Bulgaria on Friday. Ankara is pushing to lift visa requirements for its citizens travelling to Europe.
The EU is unwilling to grant Turks that concession now but, careful to avoid upsetting President Tayyip Erdoğan too much, is due to commit more money for the large number of Syrian refugees living in Turkey.



Cyprus Ambassador:  The EU should tell Turkey that gunboat diplomacy is over 
The European Union should make Turkey understand that in the 21st, century gunboat diplomacy has no place, Kornelios Korneliou, Permanent Representative of Cyprus to the EU told EURACTIV in an exclusive interview. In October, Turkey sent naval vessels specialising in seismic exploration, into Cyprus’ Exclusive Economic Zone, without permission.


            ","The European Union on Monday (13 February) called on Turkey to avoid threats and “refrain from any actions that might damage good neighbourly” ties after Cyprus accused the Turkish military of obstructing a ship exploring for gas. Cyprus said on Sunday the Turkish military had obstructed a vessel contracted by Italian oil company ENI which was approaching an area to explore for natural gas. Greek Cypriots run Cyprus’s internationally recognised government, while Turkish Cypriots have a breakaway state in the north – recognised only by Ankara – and say resources around the island belong to them too. After speaking to the Cyprus President Nicos Anastasiades, European Council President Donald Tusk urged Turkey to “avoid threats or actions against any EU member and instead commit to good neighbourly relations, peaceful dispute settlement and respect for territorial sovereignty.” Turkey’s foreign ministry made no mention of the ENI ship in a statement on Sunday, but said the case was a unilateral move by Greek Cypriots that violated the sovereign rights of Turkish Cypriots. It said the Greek Cypriots were jeopardising security and stability on the island and in the region.

                The EU has set itself an ambitious social agenda in the shape of the European Pillar of Social Rights, but the biggest test will be whether decision makers will put their money where their mouths are by providing the necessary funds, writes Jana Hainsworth.
Jana Hainsworth is the president of Social Platform, the largest European civil society alliance fighting for social justice.
Negotiations of the EU budget can degenerate into the fierce protection of national interests, or they can offer the opportunity to stand above the parapet and look at the long-term, collective interests of the EU-27.
Social Platform members, representing tens of thousands of local and national civil society organisations working with and for people who are among the most excluded in society, know very well the added-value of an EU committed to its ambition of protecting “human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law, and respect for human rights”.
We have witnessed how the EU can catalyse reforms and be a game changer for achieving human rights and social inclusion. For example, its ratification of the UN Convention on Persons with Disabilities has bound the EU to mainstream the rights of people with disabilities throughout its work. 
Likewise, the EU’s regulation and monitoring efforts on EU spending of cohesion money have pushed member states to move their care and welfare systems away from institutional settings vulnerable to human rights abuses, to more individualised social and health care. The results benefit not only those with care needs and their families but society as a whole, both from a social inclusion and economic perspective.
The European Commission is now drafting its proposals for the next multi-annual financial framework. Following the proclamation of the Pillar of Social Rights in November 2017, it is critical that the EU puts its money where its mouth is.
 Realising its three objectives – equal opportunities and access to the labour market; fair working conditions; social protection and inclusion – will not happen without concerted effort.  Careful planning and preparation of EU funding programmes will be key.
Part of the solution is to improve coherence and management of the EU budget as a whole. There should be tighter links between EU funding and implementation of EU values and objectives. Accountability of spending needs to move away from bureaucratic and burdensome administrative processes towards measuring impact. 
Beneficiaries need more flexibility during implementation to adjust activities to reality. There needs to be more openness to learning from mistakes, rather than the current EU obsession for documenting good practices. 
Finally, all EU spending programmes need to be assessed for their social impact; too often the EU has invested in infrastructure or economic development projects with little or no regard for how different population groups are affected, in particular, the most vulnerable.
On 15 and 16 February, the Bulgarian Presidency hosts an important conference on ‘Investing in People’-  a timely moment to take stock of learning from past funding through the European Social Fund (ESF) and the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived (FEAD).  
Social Platform sees the successor to these instruments as key to the delivery of the Pillar of Social Rights. Although EU money can only ever be a drop in the ocean compared to social spending as a whole and shouldn’t replace national spending commitments, it can be a powerful catalyst for reform. 
It should not only look at employment but rather address drivers of social exclusion more broadly, encompassing a range of social standards including adequate income support and universal access to quality services. We would argue that tackling homelessness, ending child poverty and developing long-term care solutions is probably more important to Europe’s future prosperity than short-term jobs creation. 
Commissioner Thyssen refers to the Pillar of Social Rights as a “compass”.  But for it to meaningfully guide future policy across the EU, it needs an ambitious vision for implementation, funding and accountability mechanisms. The next EU budget will be a critical piece of the puzzle.

                Greece and its creditors will discuss the appropriate type of post-programme surveillance of the country or any support arrangement “at the appropriate time”, a European Commission spokesperson told EURACTIV.com.
“We do not wish to speculate or make further comment on that form at this time […] the precise details of any post-programme support arrangement, and the appropriate type of post-programme surveillance as provided for in EU law, will be discussed at the appropriate time,” the EU official said.
According to the Commission spokesperson, Greece has made substantial progress under the ESM stability support programme and further work on the reform commitments is taking place in view of the months to come.
“All partners are currently working to ensure that the programme can be concluded successfully this summer.”
The Commission remarks came in response to EURACTIV’s request for a comment on Bank of Greece Governor Yannis Stournaras’ support of the idea that Greece should be inducted into a “precautionary credit line” after the end of the bailout.



Greece wants clean break from lenders, preparing own post-bailout plan
Greece expects to make a clean break with official lenders when its international bailout expires in August and has no reason to seek a precautionary credit line, its finance minister has told Reuters.


According to the central bank chief, this would help boost investor confidence and drive borrowing costs down, although such a framework would probably come with new conditions for the country.
But the Greek government does not share this view and instead backs a “clean break” from lenders.
It also says that the precautionary credit line is not needed as the country’s credibility has been restored in recent years. In addition, the Greek economy will be backed up by a protective “cash-buffer”, the government has said.
“There may be stronger monitoring, as was the case in Portugal and Cyprus, but we will have much more freedom and we need to let the society know how we intend to use it,” Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos said on 13 February.
Tsakalotos recalled that Eurogroup’s decision last June said Greece should return to the financial markets with capital stocks.
“It would be stupid to have two buffers […] no serious person would suggest both.”
Tsakalotos stressed that Greece’s economic indicators were on the rise and the three successful returns to markets show that the planned exit from the bailout after August will be successful.
Last July, Stournaras said it was “early” for Greece to make a comeback to the markets.  The Governor of the Bank of Greece had asked for 3-4 privatisations instead of a foray into the markets, in order to strengthen investors’ confidence.
“His assumption was not confirmed,” Tsakalotos said.
Relations between the government and Stournaras, who was appointed by the previous right-wing New Democracy government, are not easy.
Government officials and Stournaras often bicker over the country’s future economic course and ruling Syriza politicians say his statements dampen positive sentiment in the economy.

                Tunisia is at a turning point, which makes now the perfect time to support its vibrant but fragile democracy and turn it into one of Europe’s strongest allies in the region, write Frédérique Ries and Fulvio Martusciello.
MEP Frédérique Ries is a member of ALDE, Belgium and MEP Fulvio Martusciello is a member of EPP, Italy.
The Arab Spring – that spontaneous outburst of democratic fervour across the Arab and Muslim world – captivated us and filled us with hope in 2011. For the first time in years, we saw spontaneous protests for democracy, human rights and free speech across the region, leading to the toppling of dictators and authoritarian regimes in many countries.
Yet that revolution quickly led to disappointment and often chaos wherever it had a chance to prosper. Everywhere, that is, except one country: Tunisia, where it all began.
Tunisia may be currently experiencing unrest due to discontent among some parts of the population over slow growth. Yet we must first look at the positives: the country has confounded sceptics by building a stable, vibrant democracy in North Africa – one that could arguably teach some European democracies a thing or two – and ensuring stability despite the much-feared opening of the public space to often conflicting viewpoints.
Tunisia is proof that democracy can thrive in an Arab, Muslim country, without endangering secularism, women’s rights or minority rights. Indeed, in the 2018 Freedom House report, Tunisia is the only North African country deemed “free.”
Since its democratic transition in 2011, Tunisia has held two successful parliamentary elections and one equally democratic and peaceful presidential election. Its national legislature is a multi-party assembly, in which no single political grouping has the majority, and its press is just as pluralistic and free.
That is no small feat, considering the number of years the country had to endure dictatorship and limited human rights – and should be an example for the entire region, where too many countries still endure authoritarian rulers, crackdowns on free speech and muzzled media.
Tunisia’s secular model is precious at a time when other formerly secular countries in the Muslim world – such as Turkey – are backsliding into Islamism. The feminist cause is strong in Tunisia, and the country boasts the highest percentage of female Members of Parliament in the Arab world.
A new 2017 law enshrines women’s rights by criminalising marital rape and sexual harassment, making gender-based wage discrimination illegal and raising the age of consent for women to 16, to reflect similar laws in Europe.
Alongside Morocco, Tunisia is also a rare bastion of stability in North Africa – and has, therefore, become a key partner in the fight against terror, in strategic defence cooperation with the EU, NATO and the USA, and in controlling migratory flows towards Europe.
At a time when Europe needs all the allies it can get to stem the flows of people trying to cross the Mediterranean, to fight radicalisation at home and abroad, and to cooperate in identifying, tracking and catching terrorists, Tunisia is a natural ally for the West.
Additionally, the country is also reforming its economy after years of kleptocratic governance under former president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.
Tunisia’s current government pledged last year to increase economic growth to 5 percent in 2020 compared with an expected rate of 2.5% in 2017, alongside a promise to halve the budget deficit to 3% of GDP by that year from 6% in 2017. The government also set targets for lowering the public sector wage bill and shrinking the debt-to-GDP ratio.
These reforms will not happen overnight – hence impatience shown in recent protests. Many point to current tensions over limited growth, current inflation, and the slow pace of reform as a sign of instability. Of course, young people are impatient to reap the benefits of a revolution that they largely led.
While unemployment nationally is at 15% of the active population, 30% of young higher education graduates are jobless: these figures must be reversed.
Current tensions have also been stoked in part by Islamist movements seeking to endanger Tunisia’s secular, modern democracy. That is why we must support the continued work of the Tunisian government under Beji Caid Essebsi and Youssef Chahed – secular, moderate, democratic leaders showing the world that Tunisia can be a model for modern democracy in the Arab and Muslim world.
Tunisia can, should and must be one of our strongest allies in the region, supported by work towards closer economic ties with Europe, more military and continued intelligence cooperation.
We must support Tunisia – because doing so means supporting the idea that a North African, Arab, Muslim country can be a champion for democracy, women’s rights and secularism in a region that so sorely needs it.

                A school built with EU money now stands at the site where thousands of tonnes of concrete were produced to fulfill the fever dreams of Albania’s bunker-obsessed Communist dictator, Enver Hoxha. EURACTIV’s partner efe-epa reports from Tirana.
A forlorn area on the banks of the river that flows through the capital hosts a modern school funded by the European Union, as can be seen in images made available by EURACTIV’s partner epa on Wednesday.
“The special thing about our school is that the facilities are built according to European standards,” its director, Gjergi Vangjeli, told EFE.
Inaugurated in September 2017, the Ardian Klosi school – named after a famed Albanian writer, publicist and translator – teaches children at both the primary and secondary level.
It is part of a larger urban complex that also includes a nursery, a preschool and a multifunctional socio-cultural centre, all of them built using EU funds.
The complex is located in Tirana’s Bregu i Lumit (“Riverbank”) area, which was once the main source of concrete used during Enver Hoxha’s bunkerisation programme in 1967-86, which resulted in the construction of more than 170,000 bunkers which still riddle the country’s landscape, although they are now in an advanced state of abandonment.



Albania PM: We expect green light to open EU talks this year
Albania has done most of its homework on judiciary, crime and corruption and expects a “straightforward recommendation” to open EU accession talks this year, its prime minister told EURACTIV.com on Friday (26 January).


Eduard Kukan, a Slovakian Member of the European Parliament belonging to the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), visited the school on Tuesday as part of an EP delegation attending the 12th EU-Albania Stabilization and Association Council.
Albania has been a candidate to join the EU since June 2014 and has signed a Stabilization and Association Agreement with the bloc, which grants the Balkan nation access to funding and trade partnerships in exchange for strengthening its democracy and rule of law in order to promote stability in the region.
“I’m positively impressed by what I’ve seen at this school and it fills me with pride to know that this excellent project was funded with EU money,” Kukan told EFE during the visit.
The area surrounding the school has been restructured with new street lighting, gardens and paving, thus giving the neighborhood _ one of Tirana’s poorest _ a fresh, reinvigorated look.



'Yugo-stalgic' Balkans long for socialist past
The breakup of Yugoslavia brought more harm than good, according to a new survey. ‘Yugo-stalgia’ and dissatisfaction caused by low employment and political instability mean many yearn for the days of socialism.


Its 380 students are able to attend free extra-curricular activities such as painting, literature, song or dance classes, as well as take chess lessons and participate in multiple sports, which is unusual in Albania, as parents normally have to pay for these activities out of their own pockets.
The pupils have several laboratories, computer rooms and interactive blackboards at their disposal, while the school possesses locker rooms equipped with hot showers, an auditorium, a canteen and solar panels that provide power for heating purposes.

“We are already in the EU,” said Vangjeli. “Everything here conforms to European standards.”
Kukan said he was surprised that the children were able to communicate in English, one of the three foreign languages taught at the school, along with German and Italian.
Most of the students came from impoverished backgrounds: many were born into families that moved to the Bregu i Lumit area after the fall of Communism and built illegal shacks on top of the now-depleted former quarries that provided the rocks destined for Hoxha’s legion of bunkers.
Kukan also visited a community centre that welcomed many children from the Roma and Egyptian ethnic minorities.
“The kids come here to pass their leisure time with different activities, they do their homework, and we play psycho-social games so they don’t stay outside on the streets,” Arjola Pciri, a social worker at the centre, told EFE.
Albania, currently a NATO member, finds itself awaiting the start of accession negotiations with Brussels, which is set to kick-start a lengthy process that generally takes several years until it materializes into full EU membership.



Albania grapples with cannabis, a hurdle to EU accession
As Albania gears up for elections, one huge challenge facing the Balkan country has been low on the campaign agendas: the scourge of its cannabis fields, which threatens to hinder EU accession.


The EU constitutes Albania’s largest financial donor, with an investment of €1.24 billion between 2007-20.
Out of the country’s population of about 2.8 million, one million citizens are under the age of 19, making it one of the youngest demographics in Europe.
Despite the economic progress achieved in the past decade, many Albanian minors live in poverty and suffer mistreatment.
In comparison to the country’s poverty rate of approximately 14.3%, child poverty stood at 20.1% in 2012, according to a report by the Albanian Statistics Institute and World Bank figures.

            ","A school built with EU money now stands at the site where thousands of tonnes of concrete were produced to fulfill the fever dreams of Albania’s bunker-obsessed Communist dictator, Enver Hoxha. EURACTIV’s partner efe-epa reports from Tirana. A forlorn area on the banks of the river that flows through the capital hosts a modern school funded by the European Union, as can be seen in images made available by EURACTIV’s partner epa on Wednesday. “The special thing about our school is that the facilities are built according to European standards,” its director, Gjergi Vangjeli, told EFE. Inaugurated in September 2017, the Ardian Klosi school – named after a famed Albanian writer, publicist and translator – teaches children at both the primary and secondary level. It is part of a larger urban complex that also includes a nursery, a preschool and a multifunctional socio-cultural centre, all of them built using EU funds. The complex is located in Tirana’s Bregu i Lumit (“Riverbank”) area, which was once the main source of concrete used during Enver Hoxha’s bunkerisation programme in 1967-86, which resulted in the construction of more than 170,000 bunkers which still riddle the country’s landscape, although they are now in an advanced state of abandonment. Albania PM: We expect green light to open EU talks this year Albania has done most of its homework on judiciary, crime and corruption and expects a “straightforward recommendation” to open EU accession talks this year, its prime minister told EURACTIV.com on Friday (26 January). Eduard Kukan, a Slovakian Member of the European Parliament belonging to the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), visited the school on Tuesday as part of an EP delegation attending the 12th EU-Albania Stabilization and Association Council. Albania has been a candidate to join the EU since June 2014 and has signed a Stabilization and Association Agreement with the bloc, which grants the Balkan nation access to funding and trade partnerships in exchange for strengthening its democracy and rule of law in order to promote stability in the region. “I’m positively impressed by what I’ve seen at this school and it fills me with pride to know that this excellent project was funded with EU money,” Kukan told EFE during the visit. The area surrounding the school has been restructured with new street lighting, gardens and paving, thus giving the neighborhood _ one of Tirana’s poorest _ a fresh, reinvigorated look. 'Yugo-stalgic' Balkans long for socialist past The breakup of Yugoslavia brought more harm than good, according to a new survey. ‘Yugo-stalgia’ and dissatisfaction caused by low employment and political instability mean many yearn for the days of socialism. Its 380 students are able to attend free extra-curricular activities such as painting, literature, song or dance classes, as well as take chess lessons and participate in multiple sports, which is unusual in Albania, as parents normally have to pay for these activities out of their own pockets. The pupils have several laboratories, computer rooms and interactive blackboards at their disposal, while the school possesses locker rooms equipped with hot showers, an auditorium, a canteen and solar panels that provide power for heating purposes.

[EPA-EFE/MALTON DIBRA] “We are already in the EU,” said Vangjeli. “Everything here conforms to European standards.” Kukan said he was surprised that the children were able to communicate in English, one of the three foreign languages taught at the school, along with German and Italian. Most of the students came from impoverished backgrounds: many were born into families that moved to the Bregu i Lumit area after the fall of Communism and built illegal shacks on top of the now-depleted former quarries that provided the rocks destined for Hoxha’s legion of bunkers. Kukan also visited a community centre that welcomed many children from the Roma and Egyptian ethnic minorities. “The kids come here to pass their leisure time with different activities, they do their homework, and we play psycho-social games so they don’t stay outside on the streets,” Arjola Pciri, a social worker at the centre, told EFE. Albania, currently a NATO member, finds itself awaiting the start of accession negotiations with Brussels, which is set to kick-start a lengthy process that generally takes several years until it materializes into full EU membership. Albania grapples with cannabis, a hurdle to EU accession As Albania gears up for elections, one huge challenge facing the Balkan country has been low on the campaign agendas: the scourge of its cannabis fields, which threatens to hinder EU accession. The EU constitutes Albania’s largest financial donor, with an investment of €1.24 billion between 2007-20. Out of the country’s population of about 2.8 million, one million citizens are under the age of 19, making it one of the youngest demographics in Europe. Despite the economic progress achieved in the past decade, many Albanian minors live in poverty and suffer mistreatment. In comparison to the country’s poverty rate of approximately 14.3%, child poverty stood at 20.1% in 2012, according to a report by the Albanian Statistics Institute and World Bank figures.

                Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn suddenly resigned yesterday (15 February) in what he described as a bid to smooth reforms, following years of violent unrest that threatened the ruling party’s hold on Africa’s second most populous nation.
The resignation – unprecedented in Ethiopia’s history – followed a wave of strikes this week in towns near the capital and demonstrations successfully demanding the release of more opposition leaders.
More than 6,000 political prisoners have been freed since January as the government struggles to placate simmering anger among the two largest ethnic groups, the Oromo and Amharic, who complain they are under-represented in the country’s corridors of power.



Ethiopian Ambassador: ‘Anti-peace elements’ took advantage of Oromia, Amhara protests
Ethiopia is a secure, stable country in the Horn of Africa, says Ethiopia’s Ambassador to the EU, Teshome Toga. However, he admits “gaps” in governance have fuelled year-long protests that have left hundreds dead.


The prime minister leads the nation under Ethiopia’s political system and Hailemariam’s resignation underscores the depth of division within the ruling coalition over how fast to pursue political reform.
Ethiopia is the region’s largest economy and a key Western ally in the fight against Islamist militancy but rights groups criticize its government for jailing journalists and political opponents.



Commission to Ethiopia: ‘Start addressing legitimate grievances of your people’
The European Commission issued a stinging rebuke to one of its lead partners on the African continent on Friday (2 December), telling the Ethiopian government to “start addressing the legitimate grievances of the Ethiopian people.”


It was not clear who would replace Hailemariam. He also resigned as chairman of the ruling coalition, which has governed since it defeated a military regime in 1991.
“Unrest and a political crisis have led to the loss of lives and displacement of many,” Hailemariam said in a televised speech. “I see my resignation as vital in the bid to carry out reforms that would lead to sustainable peace and democracy.”
Popular anger
Hundreds of people were killed by security forces in unrest in Ethiopia’s two most populous regions – Oromiya and Amhara – in 2015 and 2016. Opposition to an urban development plan for the capital Addis Ababa sparked public demonstrations against political restrictions, land grabbing and human rights abuses.



Ethiopia admits 2016 unrest death toll reached 669
The official death toll from last year’s civil unrest in Ethiopia came to 669 people, according to a report to the parliament in Addis Ababa this week.


“Much of the public anger stems from the fact that the Tigryan ethnic group, representing 6% of the population, control key business interests, hold senior level positions in government and the military, and own significant land at the expense of other ethnic groups,” wrote Ahmed Salim, vice president at Teneo global advisory firm in a briefing note.
Some foreign-owned firms were attacked in the violence, damaging government efforts to attract investment and accelerate industrialization. Ethiopia’s largely state-driven economy is gradually opening to foreign investors, although sectors such as telecoms and construction remain tightly controlled.
Hailemariam, a 52-year-old former university dean, will stay on as prime minister in a caretaker capacity until the ruling Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) and parliament name a new premier.
Shiferaw Shigute, head of the EPRDF office, said the coalition would appoint a successor soon.
“Apart from the sporadic security issues … it is business as usual. The government is stable,” he said. “In our country’s history, it is the first time that a sitting leader has stepped down from power voluntarily.”
There is pressure for a member of the Oromo ethnic group to get the post, said a source close to a ruling party member. The foreign minister is the most senior Oromo in government.
Violence, the reforms 
The resignation follows a ruling party reshuffle that began in November and sidelined a number of senior members, including the widow of the former prime minister.
In January, the government has speeded up reforms, releasing prisoners and closing a notorious prison where activists say torture was common.



Ethiopia frees prominent opposition leader
Prominent Ethiopian opposition leader Merera Gudina was freed from jail yesterday (17 January) after the government dropped charges against him as part of a wider prisoner amnesty, state media reported.


“The political landscape is shifting quickly and they have to accommodate the people’s demands if they want to continue to govern,” said Ahmed Soliman, an Africa research associate at London think tank Chatham House.
Most of the released prisoners, who included high level opposition figures and journalists, had been accused of involvement in the protests or terrorism.
The prime minister wanted even more prisoner releases, said a regional analyst familiar with Ethiopian politics. He asked not to be named in order not to jeopardize his relationship with the government.
“I think he wanted to empty the jails of all political prisoners,” the analyst said. But, he said, “I don’t think the resignation is a sign that the hardliners have won. They will probably continue on the path of reform, albeit not to the scale and speed that people want.”
Former opposition lawmaker Girma Seifu warned that breaking the coalition’s stranglehold on power would take more than the resignation of one man. The coalition has controlled every seat in Ethiopia’s 547-strong parliament since 2015, when Seifu lost his post.
“This (resignation) is not something to cheer about. In my opinion, the whole parliament had to be disbanded and a transitional phase enacted,” he said.
“Whoever replaces him (Hailemariam) has to have in mind a transition. Otherwise it will only be a false start.”

                Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has opened up his entire reviewing agenda, challenging sovereign rights everywhere and basically testing the West’s limits, political scientist Tasos Chatzivasileiou told EURACTIV Greece in an interview.
The best answer for the EU and Greece would be to have a common line against an “unpredictable” leader who is not interested anymore in joining the EU, he insisted.
Tasos Chatzivasileiou is a political scientist specialised in Turkish politics and Deputy Secretary for International Relations and European Union of New Democracy, Greece’s conservative main opposition party.
He spoke to EURACTIV’s Sarantis Michalopoulos. 
We have lately seen a sudden escalation in Greek-Turkish relations, especially after the incident near the Imia islets in the eastern Aegean. Turkish warships also blocked an Italian drilling ship on course to explore for gas in Cyprus. How do you explain it?
Recep Tayyip Erdoğan currently feels that Turkey has far less than it is entitled to, considering that it’s a country with an imperial past and a population of more than 80 million inhabitants. In addition to the pressure in the east due to the war in Syria, there are two smaller countries, Greece and Cyprus, with disproportionate geopolitical displacement compared to its own size.
So, Erdoğan is challenging the sovereign rights everywhere, in an effort to impose the will of the powerful. However, this behaviour is turning international relations decades back.
Politically, how could it be interpreted?
Erdoğan has opened up his entire reviewing agenda, basically testing the West’s limits. He thus shows that he has the ability to engage simultaneously on three different fronts by sending a message in all directions that he is ready for everything at all times.



Cyprus, Turkey spar after warships block gas drilling ship
Cyprus yesterday (11 February) insisted Turkey had breached “international law” after Ankara’s warships blocked an Italian drilling ship on course to explore for gas in the island’s politically sensitive waters.


What do you believe about the EU’s reaction to the developments?
This is the first time the Europeans have reacted in a determined way. They sent a message to Ankara that as long as it continues to violate human rights within the country and on the other hand turn against EU member states, the European path is blocked.
Of course, Erdoğan, in his attempt to prevent the formation of a Kurdish state in the south of Syria, is fighting alone in Afrin, ignoring both European and American political objectives, risking the complete collapse of his relations with the West.
Three fronts:
Middle East: He has been involved in a war and so far he has been managing losses.
Cyprus: Erdoğan will not allow Nicosia to become an international energy hub that will deprive Ankara of such a role in the region. Turkey, therefore, harasses research vessels to place the area as controversial and discourage any further drilling in the future.
Aegean: Here, there is a (Turkish) hard line claiming the “grey zones”, as the Turkish policy has described them for years. So, he wants to stress that he “does not forget” the demand for “co-management” and “co-responsibility” in the Aegean. With this attitude, he wants to show the Greeks that they should not feel relaxed in the Aegean because his country has been focusing on Afrin.
In the past, every time Turkey made a provocation, the country’s leadership was lowering the tone the next day. Today, we have the opposite: Erdoğan comes out the next day and escalates. This shows that this is a plan that will continue.
There is a fine line between an accident or an incident and a real crisis. Because it is very likely that mistakes occur and could potentially lead to uncontrolled situations because when a big military force is geographically concentrated in such a small region, it is easy to make a mistake with a chain reaction.
What is Russia’s role in this situation?
Russia and Turkey have now common interests in the Middle East, which is the main reason for freezing Turkey’s relations with the West.
In the Balkans and the Middle East, Russia plays the role of a spoiler and this is the attitude it will continue to have.
So, what should the EU and Greece do from now on?
They have to follow a single line: the red lines of our policy are the international treaties and the international law, which is also binding for Turkey.
The EU must send out a clear message that the European perspective is dead if this policy continues. From its part, Greece has to formulate a new policy in its relations with Ankara. This new strategy will assume that the leverage of Turkey’s European perspective is non-existent. Therefore, it must redesign a new bilateral strategy that is based on today’s reality, meaning a country with an unpredictable leader and a non-European line. A Turkey that is not interested in its EU accession at the end of the day.

                The European Union told Turkey today (16 February) it would not ease travel requirements for its citizens unless Ankara softens counter-terrorism laws that the bloc says are excessive.
The EU has been taken aback by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s security crackdown following a botched coup in 2016 that saw some 50,000 people, including journalists, arrested and 150,000 more, from teachers to judges to soldiers, sacked or suspended from their jobs.
That has soured the bloc’s relations with its NATO ally that is also instrumental in keeping a lid on Middle East immigration to Europe.
Turkey has been seeking to mend ties, telling the EU this month it had met all criteria for visa-free travel to the bloc.
Erdoğan will meet European Council chief Donald Tusk, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov in the Bulgarian Black Sea city of Varna on 26 March. Lifting the visa requirement for Turkish nationals is expected to feature among the issues discussed.



Turkey to press for visa-free travel at Varna summit
EU diplomats expect Turkey to press the issue of visa liberalisation during the upcoming summit in Varna on 26 March. It is still unclear if this is a real priority for Ankara or just negotiating tactics as part of a bigger picture.


But Belgium Foreign Minister Didier Reynders said Ankara must first ease its terrorism laws, which Turkey has long declined to do. Turkey says it needs them, given the severity of security threats it faces on its own soil and in the region.
“If it is possible to align the legislation with the values of the European Union, it will be possible to make some progress,” Reynders said on the sidelines of an EU foreign ministers’ meeting joined by Turkey’s EU minister, Ömer Çelik.
“The link is this – a real evolution in Turkey in the legislation on terrorism and the possibility to move on the visas.”
The EU suspended Turkey’s long-stalled membership talks last year over democracy concerns under Erdoğan and his jibes at some of the bloc’s members. But next month it is expected to offer Ankara more money for hosting Syrian refugees.
The EU’s top enlargement official, Johannes Hahn, said the bloc’s executive European Commission in Brussels was analysing the Turkish visa documents.
“Turkey understands that in principle Europe is the most reliable and predictable neighbour they have, and they are well advised to have a good relationship,” he told reporters. “There are some signals but when it comes to issues of rule of law, the situation is still not satisfactory.”
Çelik, who did not speak to journalists on arriving for the talks, will also discuss with the EU ministers Turkey’s latest military intervention in the Syrian province of Afrin, which the bloc has expressed concern about.
Erdoğan on Thursday hosted the top US diplomat, Rex Tillerson, in a bid to ease the latest tensions between the two over their policies in the multi-sided war in Syria.
Turkey frees journalist
German-Turkish journalist Deniz Yücel, who was detained in Turkey a year ago, has been released from jail, German newspaper Die Welt reported today, citing his lawyer.

The German Foreign Ministry confirmed his release, and a spokesperson said that Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has welcomed the move.
Yücel, a reporter for Die Welt, was jailed on suspicion of spreading propaganda in support of a terrorist organisation and inciting violence. He denied the accusations and no indictment was made.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel yesterday demanded a fast and fair judicial process to secure the release of Yücel.

                France’s politicians are holding out for transnational lists for the 2019 European elections, despite opposition from the European Parliament. EURACTIV.fr reports.
Members of Parliament from La République en Marche (LREM) are facing opposition to the idea transnational lists in the draft law on the election of MEPs.
With their parliamentary majority, LREM MPs had no trouble rejecting the amendments of their Les Républicains colleagues, to remove the clause supported by the French President, during a vote in the National Assembly on 14 February.
For Les Républicains, keeping transnational lists is tantamount to a denial of democracy, as the European Parliament voted against such lists on 7 February.
“A democratic debate already took place and resulted in a gap of more than 100 votes against transnational lists,” said the EPP MEP Franck Proust, whose political group led the opposition against the project in the Parliament.
However, for LREM the debate is not over yet as last week’s vote was only advisory, and the Council is due to hold an informal meeting on the matter on 23 February.



European Parliament votes against transnational lists
MEPs rejected the idea of a transnational list for the 2019 European elections on Wednesday (7 February), though they agreed to change the composition of the Parliament in light of Brexit. EURACTIV.fr reports.


For Pervenche Berès, a socialist MEP in favour of transnational lists, the result of the French MPs vote is “all for nothing”, as any modifications in the European electoral code require unanimity in the Council.
Especially as a number of countries, particularly members of the Visegrad group have already made their opposition known.
The Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker, also stated that the project would be impracticable by 2019: “Following the vote at the Parliament, I do not see how it could be done by 2019.”
In a document published on 14 February in preparation for the informal summit next week, the Commission pointed out the obstacles to these constituencies at a European level, nevertheless stating that it remained “sympathetic” to the idea.



Transnational lists – A bad good idea
Transnational lists are a good idea to strengthen democracy at a European level but a closer look at it reveals “a bad good idea”. Steven Van Hecke and Wouter Wolfs voice their three main reservations on the subject.


“Transnational lists are utopian”, said Franck Proust adding that even with the approval of the Council, they would not be ready by 2019. “On which campaign accounts would they be based, for example? These lists are an image, a symbol.”
For Yannick Jadot, MEP of the Greens/EFA, the draft law on election procedure is not just about next year’s election. By writing the reform into French law, it would leave the option open for European elections after 2019 as well.
“The notion of a separate European democracy, in addition to the 28 national democracies of the member states, needs to be accepted for the notion of transnational lists to work. This is far from being the case in many of the countries,” said the MEP.
But the draft law still has many obstacles to face, as after the final vote at the Assembly it could still be examined by the Constitutional Council.
Les Républicains MP Pierre-Henri Dumont has already announced that his party would appeal the draft law, therefore questioning the legal viability of these lists.

                The Greek Union of Judges and Prosecutors called for “calmness and sobriety” on Friday (16 February), following a lawsuit by former Prime Minister Antonis Samaras against Premier Alexis Tsipras and Prosecutor of Corruption Eleni Touloupaki over the Novartis scandal.
“Calmness and sobriety are a prerequisite for shedding light on the case,” the Union said in a statement and expressed its concerns about the lawsuit launched by the former conservative prime minister (New Democracy-EPP).
Samaras, whose name appears in the Novartis case file, noted on 15 February that under Tsipras’s responsibility a “miserable conspiracy was set up”, which threatens the democratic regime.
“At a time when Greece faces great challenges and threats, they [the government] are lying and besmearing their opponents by dividing the Greek people,” Samaras said.
Samaras also sued two of the three protected witnesses, three prosecutors and Alternate Minister for Corruption Issues Dimitris Papangelopoulos.
The leftist government reacted with irony, referring to a “persistent persecution complex”.
“The only thing, however, that persecutes him, is his past. We recommend that he sues it too.”
Government spokesperson Dimitris Tzanakopoulos called Samaras’ lawsuit and “unprecedented move” and accused him of interfering with the work of Justice.
“The way he refers to prosecutors, in this case, could be interpreted as an attempt to manipulate, terrorise, or even blackmail the Greek justice,”  Tzanakopoulos said.



Pharma scandal whips up political storm in Greek opposition ranks
A probe into illegal practices of Swiss drugmaker Novartis in Greece, involving thousands of state officials and doctors, has opened the Pandora’s Box in Greek politics as local media have named ten former bigwigs from opposition parties as being targeted by the investigation.


EU Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos, whose name is also in the case file, has also sued the two protected witnesses for perjury and defamation.
The European Commission has declined to make a comment on the issue.
“Those who threaten, intimidate or sue judges trying to do their job in accordance with the Constitution, I refer them to the announcements of the Supreme Court and even the ‘delayed’ announcement of the Union of Judges,” European Parliament Vice-President Dimitris Papadimoulis [Syriza] told EURACTIV.com.
The Novartis investigation was launched in mid-December 2016 with evidence of bribery of thousands of state officials and doctors in order for Novartis to get preferential treatment in the market.
The scandal has opened the Pandora’s Box in Greek politics as ten high-ranking politicians, all belonging to the opposition parties of New Democracy and Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement (S&D), appeared in the case file.
The Greek probe followed a two-year investigation conducted by the US authorities on the methods Novartis allegedly used to prevail in the market.
It is estimated that the cash-strapped country has lost approximately €3 billion due to the scandal.
Next Wednesday (21 February), a debate and vote on the proposal by the parliamentary majority to set up a preliminary investigation committee for the Novartis case will take place.

                Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama said yesterday (18 February) his country and Kosovo could one day have a single president as a “symbol of national unity” between Tirana and Pristina.
In a remark certain to anger Belgrade, Rama noted that the two neighbours, both predominantly ethnic Albanian, already share diplomatic missions around the world, adding: “Why not a single president, as a symbol of national unity?”
Rama was addressing Kosovo’s parliament to mark the 10th anniversary of the country’s unilateral declaration of independence from Serbia, a move recognised by more than 110 countries, though not by Belgrade or Moscow.


Kosovo turns 10 but has little to celebrate https://t.co/gE7ZjO9WG3

Serbia has repeatedly accused Tirana of wanting to build a “Greater Albania”, an aspiration it denies.
Efforts to normalise ties between Belgrade and Pristina, begun in 2011, have stalled.
Rama said he saw a future in which “Albanians and Serbians will co-exist… like two countries with good neighbourly relations that are an integral part of the European Union.”
In 1998, a war broke out between Kosovo’s ethnic Albanian rebels and Serbian troops that left 13,000 people dead, most of them Albanians. Belgrade withdrew its forces the following year after a NATO bombing campaign against Serbia.

Kosovo subsequently became a United Nations protectorate and, with the support of Washington and other Western powers, declared independence from Belgrade on 17 February 2008.
“The state of Kosovo has upheld the people’s demand for freedom,” Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj said in a special government session in Pristina on Saturday.
But “we are aware that citizens’ expectations for a modern state have not yet been fulfilled”.
Although more than 110 countries have recognised Kosovo’s independence in the past 10 years, Serbia and dozens of other states have not.
Sovereignty is rejected by Russia, whose Security Council veto prevents Kosovo from joining the United Nations, and five EU countries: Spain, Greece, Slovakia, Romania and Cyprus.

Economic woes, ethnic division 
Kosovo’s unemployment rate of around 30% — and 50% among young people — has led tens of thousands to move abroad in search of work over the past decade.
Home to 1.8 million people, Kosovo is one of the poorest parts of Europe and hugely dependent on remittances from its diaspora to drive economic growth of around four percent.
In the Serb part of the divided northern city of Mitrovica, black-and-white posters appeared on Saturday lamenting “10 years of occupation”, with pictures of hands in cuffs.
The “normalisation” of ties between Belgrade and Pristina is crucial to both sides’ bids to join the European Union.
The former foes have reached deals on issues such as freedom of movement since EU-brokered talks began in 2011, but the dialogue has stalled over the past two years.
“Despite the great support it enjoys from Western powers, Kosovo is far, far from being recognised,” said Serbian Foreign Minister Ivica Dačić.
“Without an agreement with Serbia, this issue cannot be solved.”
Despite Belgrade’s uncompromising stance, just a few dozen protesters gathered in the Serbian capital on Saturday to rally against Kosovo’s independence, in contrast to frenzied demonstrations 10 years ago that left the US embassy in flames.
Partition concerns 
Some officials in Belgrade have raised the prospect of redrawing borders along ethnic lines.
But Kosovo’s President Hashim Thaçi insists that the country is “indivisible” and many fear a partition deal would destabilise the fragile Balkans.
US President Donald Trump sent his congratulations to Kosovo for making “great strides in strengthening its sovereignty and multi-ethnic democracy”.
“While more work must be done, we applaud your progress,” he said.
Kosovo’s ties with the West have at times been strained over the past year, as it awaits the first indictments from an EU-backed war crimes court trying members of the 1990s Kosovo Liberation Army.
Recent efforts by ruling coalition MPs to block the tribunal sparked strongly-worded warnings from the US and other Western allies.

                Europe cannot turn a blind eye to the human rights abuses occurring in third countries, unless we rewrite the mandates of the functioning of the EU institutions and the Treaty, writes MEP Tomáš  Zdechovský.
Tomáš  Zdechovský is a Czech MEP from the European People’s Party group in the European Parliament.
Engagement in geopolitics and setting standards for others to follow has always been the leading role of Europe.
Trade has been central to developing and strengthening relationships with others, in order to establish good governance, sustainable development and the protection of human rights.  But Europe’s founding principles are being increasingly diluted in favour of its strategic partnerships, focused mainly on political influence and trade surpluses.
We cannot turn a blind eye to the Human Rights abuses occurring in third countries, unless we rewrite the mandates of the functioning of the EU institutions and the Treaty.
The European External Action Service (EEAS) defends the view that the “EU’s human rights and democracy policy encompasses civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights.”
It continues by stressing that “the European Union is founded on a strong engagement to promote and protect human rights, democracy and rule of law worldwide […] This commitment underpins all internal and external policies of the European Union”.
Yet, in contradiction to the responsibility of the EEAS, the Commission for Trade actively endorses the violation of human rights through some of its trade relations including those with the Republic of the Union of Myanmar, the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the Republic of the Philippines and the Kingdom of Cambodia, to name just a few.
Much of this is done through its trade subsidy schemes, such as Everything But Arms (EBA), the Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) and the Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP + ).
In January, the European Commission published its evaluation and monitoring report of the 10 GSP+ countries. Several of these staff working documents highlight that there are serious concerns regarding the implementation and violations of the 27 Core Conventions, which are the prerequisite for obtaining GSP+. The plus (+) signifies the promotion of good governance.
In the case of Pakistan, the Commission reflects “serious concerns” relating to good governance such as: the abuse of human rights, the situation of women, the use of torture and military courts against civilians, the situation for journalists and media and the lack of compliance with International Labour Organisation standards.
Additionally,  recent reports from NGOs, the media and the Pakistan Workers’ Federation show a deterioration of the situation in the last four years, since GSP + has been granted to Pakistan. The situation is similar, but not as severe, for several other GSP+ recipient countries.
The credibility of the European Union is at stake when we ignore our duty of care to others, and indeed to our own consumers, businesses and workers inside the EU.
The cost of cheap clothes should not be underestimated. Lives are lost and destroyed in their production, and we have a responsibility to ensure trade is fair and does not allow for the violation of economic, social and cultural rights of those inside and outside of Europe.
The European Commission should be reminded that, pursuant to Article 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the EU’s common commercial policy must be conducted “in the context of the principles and objectives of the Union’s external action“, and that, pursuant to Article 3 of the Treaty on European Union, it must contribute, inter alia, to sustainable development, the eradication of poverty and protection of human rights.
The European Commission (DG Trade) and my colleagues in the Trade Committee of the European Parliament should agree to launch an investigation, at the very least, into the actual implementation of the 27 international conventions, which are the prerequisite for the granting of GSP+ and  that the recipient countries have ratified and committed to effectively implement.
Those who are violating the conditions must be suspended from the scheme, in order to reward and protect those compliant with the rules and in order to strengthen the EU’s influence globally through trade. If we don’t take the implementation of our own standards serious, we are undermining our efforts from the get-go.
A mere slap on the wrist for countries, which are breaking more than half of the requested conventions, cannot be sufficient.
So to be clear: The GSP and GSP+ trading system is a laudable tool. Let us therefore strengthen it through better implementation. The carrot does not work without the stick.

                The Czech Social Democratic Party (ČSSD) picked former parliament speaker Jan Hamáček as their chairman yesterday (18 February), bringing closer a possible breakthrough in forming a viable government.
Prime Minister Andrej Babiš is still trying to find allies after his minority government lost a confidence vote in January, mainly because of allegations that he fraudulently claimed European Union subsidies worth €2 million a decade ago.



Czech police charge leading candidate with EU funding fraud
Andrej Babiš, the Czech billionaire who is a leading candidate to become prime minister in elections next week, said yesterday (9 October) that he had been charged with fraud over EU subsidies received by one of his companies.


Babiš has denied any wrongdoing, but almost all other parties have declined to cooperate with his ANO movement which has only 78 seats in the 200-strong lower chamber of parliament and thus needs partners to form a majority.



Czech PM Babiš battles fraud charges as cabinet loses confidence vote
Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš’s minority government lost a confidence vote yesterday (16 January), forcing him to try to cut a deal with opposition parties to stay in office while he also battles allegations of subsidy fraud.


Hamáček, whose Social Democrats ruled in coalition with ANO and the Christian Democrats (KDU) from January 2014 until last December, won 272 votes at the ČSSD congress, beating former regional government chief Jan Zimola, who got 224 votes.
He had said before the congress that party members should decide whether the ČSSD with its 15 lawmakers joins a coalition with ANO or supports its minority government.
Hamáček said in a letter to party members that Babiš should not be part of such a government. This could change if the only other option was to hold an early election, he said in an interview for www.idnes.cz news website.
Only the Communist party, with 15 lawmakers, has said it might lend Babiš’ government external support, although the centre-right Mayors movement (STAN) said this week it could negotiate with ANO, something it had previously ruled out.
Analysts have said mainstream opposition parties might change their positions in order to prevent possible cooperation between ANO and the Communists or the far-right, anti-EU Freedom and Direct Democracy (SPD) party.

                In the aftermath of Brexit, which is expected to create a financial gap of €14 billion per year, doing more with less has, once again, become a cliché. But this time it is different, writes centre-right MEP Maria Spyraki.
Maria Spyraki is a member of the European People’s Party in the European Parliament and the spokesperson for Greece’s main opposition New Democracy party, an affiliate of the EPP. 
It is not Brussels as usual that just calls for more money in order to meet everyone halfway with a compromise.
These words eloquently -if not urgently- speak about the necessity for pragmatism in a time where indeed money is less, and the European Union is facing more challenges. At the same time the Union is quite stable after the first soak of facing Brexit and at the same time is overcoming the crisis and the growth rate is rising. The European Union remains one of the safest yards for investments within the globe.
The European Commission, in a communication published on the 14th of February, under the title “A new, modern Multiannual Financial Framework for a European Union that delivers efficiently on its priorities post-2020” laid out three possible scenarios for the future of EU finances for the period 2021-2027 ranked by level of ambition, which from the perspective on their impact on Cohesion Policy, translate as follows:
The less ambitious and most unrealistic, in my opinion, scenario states that support from the European Structural and Investments funds should be maintained for all Member States, thus making available some €370bn to foster economic, social and territorial cohesion.
The next scenario calls for a reduction in cohesion policy funds of up to €95bn, which will derive from the end of support to more developed and transition regions.
The most ambitious scenario will limit support only to cohesion countries, thus further reducing ESI funds by €124bn, which respond to approximately 11% of the current Multiannual Financial Framework.
That’s the big picture. Let’s now zoom into Greece, which, according to the same communication, has been the third most benefitted country in accounting terms for the period 2014-2016. This translates to receiving annually €4.8bn per year whereas EU contributions for the programming period of 2014-2020 were equal to €20,4bn. Pragmatically speaking, all countries that are among the biggest beneficiaries of the EU will be negatively affected by net accounting terms if the second or the third aforementioned scenario plays out.
Under these circumstances, if countries like Greece would like to meet these ambitious challenges, they should plan ahead. This would happen if most, if not all, of the following conditions are met:
Increase stakeholder involvement beyond the level of the direct beneficiary. Cohesion policy money has indirect, yet significant, an impact that is diffused to the entire EU. For example, as the communication states, it is estimated that a quarter of additional growth in non-cohesion countries is due to indirect benefits from increased sales to and trade with cohesion countries.
Additionality is the new subsidiarity. We need to prepare solutions that manage to mobilize funds and make cohesion funds not only the investment arm but also the investment brain of the EU by using taxpayers’ money in a smart way, thus optimizing between grants and financial instruments to have a multiplying effect. We need to blend funds from all available resources, ESIF, EFSI, Horizon 2020, CEF, etc.
Embrace uncertainty by flexibility. A practical example of that would be to enforce the Plan-Do-Check-Act virtuous circle by a solid implementation of the planned initiatives keeping a keen eye for improvements and changes when necessary. An example of that would be the reuse of decommitted funds under a Union reserve similar to the initiative that six MEP, including myself, proposed via European Parliament to the Commission for the use of unused funds to address the migration crisis back in 2016.
To conclude, I foresee that among the proposed scenarios, the first one is the least possible to move on. Member states should inevitably plan ahead if they want to move forward.

                French President Emmanuel Macron has convinced (most of) his fellow Heads of state and government to do the unimaginable: Ask Europeans what they want for the future of the Union. But the way governments are planning to go about this will lead to more frustration and confusion, write Stephen Boucher and Lex Paulson.
Stephen Boucher is visiting professor, Sciences Po Paris and Solvay Brussels School, author of Petit manuel de créativité politique – Comment libérer l’audace collective. Lex Paulson is International counselor, D21, lecturer at Sciences Po in Paris.
Back in early 2017, Mr. Macron was calling for a consultation of citizens to elicit their true intentions for the EU. What then looked like a scaled-up rerun of his electoral “Grande Marche”, with campaigners knocking on doors across a whole continent, has now been sold to some 15 (and counting) other governments as an official consultation exercise (the local canvassing will be conducted separately by Mr. Macron’s party).
Tout ça pour ça?
Do all hail deliberative democracy, EU-wide or nationally but synthesised at European level? Not quite. To appease countries such as Denmark and others opposed to a single approach, Mr. Macron has suggested that each country does its own thing, with no common methodology, no mixing of people of different countries, and an open invitation to any citizen interested to discuss a few vague questions, online or offline.
We know who will join: the usual euro-enthusiasts and sceptics, with a sprinkling of lobbyists. We therefore know the end result: a compilation of the usual views, from a national perspective, tackling topics in ways that other Europeans most likely will not relate to and without the impact and legitimacy a systematic methodology would have given.
Decades of quality deliberative processes, including across countries, have taught us how to consult citizens in order to produce meaningful input – fostering convergence, generating more effective solutions and building support from citizens.
At their core, these processes share the following qualities: a purposefully diverse – ideally representative – sample of participants, complete and balanced information, moderated discussions that ensure all perspectives are expressed, and, importantly in this case, a process that allows participants to confront others’ views, across borders.
Unless… we bring Europe together for a real deliberation
Accept that the realities of politics have landed us where we now are, what could we do now? Well, Heads of state and government could consider at least adding a high-quality deliberative element to what’s planned that could look like this:
Ask a representative sample of Europeans – working with a classic survey institute – what key issues they wish to discuss for the future of Europe.
Draw from this a smaller, yet representative sample of citizens from all 27 member states to meet for a few days in Brussels. Having received balanced information on the, say, top 3 priority topics and political options on the table, this ‘mini-Europe’ group could discuss the matters with interpretation and moderators in small groups and put questions to a diverse group of policy makers at the highest level and experts representing the diversity of opinions on the matters discussed.
Connect an online debate around this transnational platform to ensure transparency and wider participation, notably from current Europe-wide deliberations, such as Europe’s People’s Forum;
Then bring together the rich input thus produced in a concise format for EU heads of state and government.
While modest, such an addition would compensate for the current plans by being more bottom-up, representative and transnational.
Moreover, it could be implemented fast and at a limited cost, if, say, the European Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions, the European Parliament and/or the European Commission shared their venues, interpreters, survey institute, and budgets to pay for the cost of a few hundred citizens travelling to Brussels.
Civil society and academia stand ready to shape the briefing material to ensure that it’s fair and balanced.
Wanting to listen to Europe’s people is good, but only if we create the conditions for hearing what they really have to say. And act upon it.

                There is a vast potential for green gas in Europe, generated from sustainable resources such as biomass and organic waste, some of which can directly be injected into the grid or take the shape of hydrogen, writes Claude Turmes.
Claude Turmes is a Member of the European Parliament for the Greens/EFA group. He is rapporteur on the proposed regulation on the Governance of the Energy Union, which is currently making its way through the EU institutions.
On 24 November last year, the European Commission put forward their third list of Projects of Common Interests (PCI) that are meant to better connect various EU Member States and facilitate their energy supply.
However this list is in stark contradiction with the Paris Agreement and with the Union’s climate policy. It includes a long list of useless, environmentally-harmful new gas pipelines. That is why a cross-party coalition of MEPs decided to challenge this list and raise a formal objection that will be put to vote tomorrow in the European Parliament’s industry and energy committee (ITRE).
The aim of this objection is to defeat the myth showing gas as a necessary transition fuel to fight climate change, as well as to promote transparency and democracy in the decision-making around energy infrastructure.
Firstly, the European Commission as always overestimated the future of gas consumption in Europe and the PCI list is based on artificially inflated gas demand scenarios. Even the Court of Auditors identified this shortcoming in its 2015 report: “the Commission has persistently overestimated gas demand (…) and needs to restore the credibility of the forecasts it uses”.
The coal phase-out does not require more gas consumption. Wind and solar are already the cheapest energy source to invest in and are replacing conventional generation. Of course these variable energy sources need to be balanced and flexible gas turbines can play a role for that, alongside demand-side management, electricity interconnectors and storage. But these flexible gas turbines would only run for a very limited number of hours every year, meaning a small volume of gas. In addition, successful EU policy in the field of energy efficiency triggers a constantly reducing energy demand in our building stock.
Secondly, the PCI selection process is a black box, ending up with a Christmas tree to satisfy the wishes of gas transmission system operators acting as project developers. ENTSO-G cannot any more be judge and party, pretending to promote the general interest but in practice defending individual commercial interests of their TSO members. The European Parliament needs to act as a counterweight to this gas lobby exercise.
Thirdly, the development on new gas infrastructure is based on the wrong assumption that there are still major security of gas supply concerns in Europe. This assumption was true for a long time, it is not any more. Thanks to targeted investment in reverse-flow cofinanced by the EU budget and to a risk-mitigation strategy anchored in the security of gas supply regulation, the EU has critically reduced its exposure to gas supply disruption.
With the exception of some limited segments missing in South-Eastern Europe and in the Baltic region, we do not need any new gas infrastructure in Europe to ensure energy security.
Finally, a comprehensive life-cycle analysis of fossil fuel gas leaves little room for doubt: fossil fuel gas is not compatible with our climate objective to limit global warming to 1.5 to 2°C. The future of gas can only be green. That would allow the EU to make a smart use of an already existing and well performing gas transmission and distribution infrastructure.
There is a vast potential for green gas in Europe, generated from sustainable resources such as biomass and organic waste, either for local consumption or upgraded into biomethane and directly injected into the grid. In addition to being climate compatible, this strategy would generate income notably in rural areas, and enhance benefits of a truly circular economy.
Green gas can also the shape of hydrogen, where electrolysis is coupled to a fully renewable electricity generation unit. Some good examples already exist. Pilot energy islands in the North Sea are being rolled-out, reaping the full potential of electricity/gas sector coupling. French gas TSO and DSO explore the feasibility of a 100% renewable gas mix by 2050, combining anaerobic digestion, pyrogasification and power-to-gas.
EU law-makers have an opportunity tomorrow to speak out in favour of green gas, clean energy and more transparency rather than perpetuating the old fossil Jurassic world.

                In the current geopolitical context, European support for those fighting for human dignity is more important than ever, writes Shada Islam.
Shada Islam is Director of Europe & Geopolitics at Friends of Europe. This opinion piece was first posted on that organisation’s website.
They talked of war and conflict but most of the “strongmen” lashing out at each other at the recent security conference in Munich are more fearful of their own citizens than they are of each other.
Civil society activists are under increasing pressure worldwide, their pursuit of dignity and equal rights-for-all clashing with governments’ determination to silence dissent and “disobedience”.
The list of governments frightened by the voice and passion of their own citizens is shamefully long. Their repression can take the shape of state crackdowns, intimidation by “secret services”, carefully orchestrated “targeted killings”, disappearances of activists and government bans on travel.
The free press is muzzled. Minorities face discrimination, women are brutalised and abused, LGBT people are stigmatised. The vulnerable are bullied and exploited. Clearly, these governments fear their own citizens more than they do foreign armies.
It’s a strange and topsy-turvy world where any attempt to expose the plight of the poor and disenfranchised is considered unpatriotic and where standing up against brutality, intolerance and bad governance is condemned, not applauded.
Small surprise then that the much-respected UN human rights chief Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein said last year that he would not be seeking a second term in office. “To do so, in the current geopolitical context, might involve bending a knee in supplication, lessening the independence and integrity of my voice,” he explained.
The discrimination and clampdowns can be insidious. Pakistani human rights defender Asma Jahangir, who died recently, was constantly harassed, stalked and denounced as “Western”, “secular” and “pro-Indian” because of her fearlessness in speaking truth to power. The equally courageous Pakistani Nobel peace prize laureate Malala Yousafzai faces similar criticism in her home country.
Russia, China, Iran and Saudi Arabia are known for their harsh disregard for the rights of dissidents. Palestinian teenager Ahed Tamimi is being detained and tried by an Israeli military court on the charge of incitement to violence. While freeing a German national, a Turkish court has just sentenced six journalists to life in jail for alleged links to the July 2016 coup plotters despite criticism by the UN and OSCE representatives on media freedom.
Sadly, even countries that were once seen as fairly safe are becoming much less so. India fell three spots on the World Press Freedom Index to 136th in 2017, according to the watchdog group Reporters Without Borders, because of growing self-censorship and acts by Hindu nationalists trying to purge “anti-nationalist” thought.
Southeast Asia’s performance is especially disheartening. The “disappearance” of Sombath Somphone, an internationally acclaimed civil society leader who was kidnapped from the streets of Vientiane in late 2012, is a glaring example of a worsening of the human rights situation in Laos.
With elections coming up, the Cambodian government has slapped a massive tax bill on The Cambodia Daily, a local English-language newspaper often critical of the ruling elite, with many non-governmental organisations fearing a similar fate.
The human rights situation in the Philippines has deteriorated rapidly under President Rodrigo Duterte’s anti-drug campaign. Religious intolerance is on the rise in Indonesia.
In Myanmar, the military’s ethnic cleansing operations against the Rohingya Muslims show no signs of abating although over half a million Rohingya have had to flee their community, becoming refugees in Myanmar’s neighbouring states, including Thailand and Bangladesh.
US President Donald Trump’s assault on non-discrimination and equal justice at home and his “bromance” with the world’s tough guys go hand in hand with worldwide cutbacks in US support for human rights, the rule of law, and good governance.
As the US retreats from the global stage, European support for those fighting for human dignity becomes ever more important.
But “threats, physical and verbal attacks against activists” are also becoming the norm in parts of Europe, according to the EU’s Fundamental Rights Agency. The world is watching as the European Commission launches unprecedented disciplinary proceedings against Poland, and Hungary continues its intimidation of pro-democracy civil society groups.
As Michel Forst, the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights defenders said recently, many countries point to recent laws in Hungary and Poland to justify their own action against NGOs. Europe’s treatment of refugee and asylum seekers also leaves it open to criticism.
Still, the EU is funding a range of initiatives to support human rights defenders at high risk, and EU Missions in many countries have special human rights officials charged with helping to protect vulnerable groups and individuals.
Regular consultations and discussions also take place with civil society representatives as part of Europe’s relations with Africa, the Middle East, and Asia.
These initiatives are welcome and important. But they are still too-often an after-thought, a last-minute add-on to the more important talks with governments. Civil society activists have trouble getting visas to travel to Europe. Their participation in EU-sponsored events is often barred by governments.
But as experience has shown, listening only to state representatives while failing to interact with students, activists, trade unionists, members of parliaments and business leaders leads to flawed policies.
The late Asma Jahangir, who was often at the European Parliament, is no longer there to stir our conscience. But she leaves a strong legacy for many others across the world who share her dedication and passion for justice and dignity – and who deserve our support.
            ","In the current geopolitical context, European support for those fighting for human dignity is more important than ever, writes Shada Islam. Shada Islam is Director of Europe & Geopolitics at Friends of Europe. This opinion piece was first posted on that organisation’s website. They talked of war and conflict but most of the “strongmen” lashing out at each other at the recent security conference in Munich are more fearful of their own citizens than they are of each other. Civil society activists are under increasing pressure worldwide, their pursuit of dignity and equal rights-for-all clashing with governments’ determination to silence dissent and “disobedience”. The list of governments frightened by the voice and passion of their own citizens is shamefully long. Their repression can take the shape of state crackdowns, intimidation by “secret services”, carefully orchestrated “targeted killings”, disappearances of activists and government bans on travel. The free press is muzzled. Minorities face discrimination, women are brutalised and abused, LGBT people are stigmatised. The vulnerable are bullied and exploited. Clearly, these governments fear their own citizens more than they do foreign armies. It’s a strange and topsy-turvy world where any attempt to expose the plight of the poor and disenfranchised is considered unpatriotic and where standing up against brutality, intolerance and bad governance is condemned, not applauded. Small surprise then that the much-respected UN human rights chief Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein said last year that he would not be seeking a second term in office. “To do so, in the current geopolitical context, might involve bending a knee in supplication, lessening the independence and integrity of my voice,” he explained. The discrimination and clampdowns can be insidious. Pakistani human rights defender Asma Jahangir, who died recently, was constantly harassed, stalked and denounced as “Western”, “secular” and “pro-Indian” because of her fearlessness in speaking truth to power. The equally courageous Pakistani Nobel peace prize laureate Malala Yousafzai faces similar criticism in her home country. Russia, China, Iran and Saudi Arabia are known for their harsh disregard for the rights of dissidents. Palestinian teenager Ahed Tamimi is being detained and tried by an Israeli military court on the charge of incitement to violence. While freeing a German national, a Turkish court has just sentenced six journalists to life in jail for alleged links to the July 2016 coup plotters despite criticism by the UN and OSCE representatives on media freedom. Sadly, even countries that were once seen as fairly safe are becoming much less so. India fell three spots on the World Press Freedom Index to 136th in 2017, according to the watchdog group Reporters Without Borders, because of growing self-censorship and acts by Hindu nationalists trying to purge “anti-nationalist” thought. Southeast Asia’s performance is especially disheartening. The “disappearance” of Sombath Somphone, an internationally acclaimed civil society leader who was kidnapped from the streets of Vientiane in late 2012, is a glaring example of a worsening of the human rights situation in Laos.

                Three of the member states of the Visegrad group will take part in French President Emmanuel Macron’s citizens’ consultations project. Hungary has yet to make its decision known. EURACTIV.fr reports.
On 15 February, France’s Minister for European Affairs, Nathalie Loiseau, announced that 23 European countries would take part in the project (up from some ten at the beginning of January).
Poland is one of the new recruits, having recently informed the French authorities of its participation. Along with the Czech Republic and Slovakia, that means that three members of the Visegrad group have expressed their support for the French President’s project. Hungary, the other member of the group, has not announced its decision.
The Netherlands and Latvia are the other two countries that have not given an official response to the French authorities on the matter. Contacted by EurActiv the Latvian authorities expressed their support for the initiative and said that they were willing to participate.
Unveiled by Macron in his speech at the Sorbonne in September 2017, the democratic conventions are intended to allow European citizens to express their opinions on the European project. Responding to a joint set of questions, European citizens would be able to state their “priorities”, “concerns” and “ideas”, which should go towards drawing up a “roadmap for the future of Europe”.
The initiative initially met with little enthusiasm at European level and was rebranded as “citizens’ consultations” in December.



Reality catches up with Macron’s projects of European democracy
Citizen consultations, transnational lists: France is trying to carry out Macron’s project for Europe but ambition has been scaled down. EURACTIV France reports.


The major lines of the project, in principle, do not appear to sit well with the Visegrad countries’ vision of the EU. They have repeatedly expressed their support for maintaining a central role for member states and the respect of national identities.
Contacted by EurActiv, representatives of the Polish authority stressed that the consultations will have to abide by “national practices”. The Hungarian authorities repeated the same message, referring to a joint declaration by the Visegrad group on the “future of Europe” published on 26 January.
In that declaration, the four Visegrad countries called for a need to “reduce the distance between European citizens and the Brussels-based Institutions”. They declared their readiness to “conduct broad-based public consultations on the future of Europe in accordance with national practices”.
Implementation at national level
Loiseau has stated that each participating member state will determine the conditions for holding consultations, although meetings bringing together the project managers for each country will nonetheless have to be organised.
According to Yves Bertoncini, chair of the European Movement France, and a member of the steering committee which will support the French authorities on this issue, “a representative approach” will have to be ensured. He recommends establishing a “common questionnaire” to make it easier to interpret the results.
The citizens’ consultations are expected to place from mid-April to mid-October, with the results to be debated at a meeting of the participating states in December, Loiseau said.

EURACTIV.fr reports.","https://www.euractiv.com/section/future-eu/opinion/from-phones-to-polls-how-todays-youth-can-make-the-case-for-democracy/","By Ramón Luis Valcárcel and Sylvie Guillaume 22-02-2018 (updated: 23-02-2018 )","
                The European Parliament is exploring ways to convert the younger generation’s online engagement into higher turnout in the upcoming elections, write Ramón Luis Valcárcel and Sylvie Guillaume.
Ramón Luis Valcárcel and Sylvie Guillaume are Members of the European Parliament for the European People’s Party (EPP) and the Socialists and Democrats (S&D) groups. They are the Parliament’s vice-presidents in charge of information policy and citizens’ relations.
In the hyper-mediated world of today, it is easy to view young people as disinterested, uncommitted and apathetic about politics. While those of us who graduated before the fall of the Berlin Wall used to spend time between piles of books, thanks to the digital revolution, today’s youth is just a click away from countless databases and are able to ‘like’ and (un)follow politicians and policy proposals through a myriad of digital platforms.
It is the increasing importance of the virtual sphere that builds up the widespread feeling that today’s youth is apolitical. But, as Anna Widegren, secretary general of the European Youth Forum, recently explained, this is merely a myth.
Among European youngsters, there is an eagerness to shape the future. The most interconnected generation ever goes on Erasmus, surfs the internet roaming-free in 28 countries and dislikes traditional politics. Yet, is not indifferent to the challenges the European Union is facing.
Young people are worried about unemployment, migration, security, globalisation or climate change, just as we all are. The difference is in the way they engage and take action. Since digital participation is easier and faster, activities that fall beyond the reach of e-life are frequently left off their to-do lists.
But at the same time, the problem is that debating, protesting or campaigning online is not enough.
While clicktivism and other forms of civic engagement can help raise awareness of different topics among heterogeneous networks, real impact requires conversion into offline action. Youngsters’ route to democratic participation may well start on the phone, but to be effective, it has to lead to the polls.
As democratically elected representatives of more than 500 million Europeans, we do not want young people to feel underrepresented or disenfranchised when it comes to EU politics.
On the contrary: we believe that by communicating and interacting more with them we will be able to develop more adequate and credible answers to some of Europe’s biggest problems.
This is why the European Parliament is working at full speed to bring the EU closer to its citizens and vice versa. By establishing a series of activities and initiatives from which to develop an open, structured and continuous dialogue with Europe’s youth, the Parliament seeks to enable an ever more vibrant democracy.
One year out of the 2019 European elections, many debates and other participatory events will be held across all member states during the upcoming months in order to find out what Europeans think – and to legislate accordingly.
We want to delve into the best ways of empowering young people, better convincing them that they should not feel left out of the European debate, closing the turnout gap between older and younger generation, etc.
The central hub will be the European Youth Event (#EYE2018) to allow young people to campaign for things they believe in.
After two successful editions, next June the European Parliament will open its doors once again to welcome more than 8,000 young people from EU member states like Estonia, Spain, Cyprus or France to neighbouring countries like Albania or Belarus.
The two-day event will see a wide range of stimulating activities during which the roles will be reversed: youngsters will lead the conversation and Members of the European Parliament, Commissioners and other decision-makers will listen.
We will talk about ways to eradicate youth unemployment, discuss proposals for harnessing globalisation and debate on pressing issues such as the very role of social media in our democracy or the integration of asylum seekers into our society. Oh! And, of course, we will speak about Brexit too.
The most popular proposals formulated during the EYE will be included in a report and distributed to all MEPs, allowing for a truly meaningful political impact. To exemplify how young people’s ideas can be a source of inspiration to policy-makers, it is worth recalling that concrete demands from EYE 2016 participants led to real EU action.
They requested more volunteering opportunities – and the EU created Solidarity Corps. As well, they asked for a stronger commitment to tackling climate change -and the EU was the first to stand up for the Paris Agreement when it came under attack. Together, yes we can turn words and good intentions into concrete actions, by finally delivering.
However, taking part in the #EYE2018 is not the only way to make one’s voice heard before the May 2019 European Elections. As we believe that digital engagement is a first step to standardised democratic participation, the European Parliament has set up a website for the young generation to have its say on crucial issues such as inequalities, trade agreements, human rights or sexual harassment.
And it goes without saying that social media is a two-way street, hence while the Parliament uses networks like Facebook or Snapchat to keep citizens up to date with European democracy, its communication services are there to make everybody’s engagement with parliamentary processes an easier and more enjoyable activity.
We are trying our best to seize the endless opportunities that new technologies offer, but we need civic support to keep democracy alive. Youth has to take its online activism to the next level and participate offline, especially during elections. A higher mobilisation in May 2019 will mean more representativeness, and this will in turn provide for a better Europe -one that works for all indeed.
The next European Commission president is not going to be chosen with a tweet but elected in the polls in May 2019. In its last plenary session, the European Parliament overwhelmingly voted in favour of the continuation of the Spitzenkandidaten process, for citizens are the ones who must shape the future of Europe.
It is now time for youngsters to make the case for democracy, and this can only be done by converting online engagement into votes in the next election. There are many ways to call for change, but polls are the place to make it happen.

                The Greek parliament decided today (22 February) to establish a special committee that will investigate the role of politicians, including the EU’s EU Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulo’s in the alleged Novartis scandal.
Ten high-ranking politicians, all belonging to the opposition parties of New Democracy and the Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement, have appeared in the case file and will be investigated on whether they received bribes by the Swiss drugmaker Novartis.
Among the politicians are former Prime Minister Antonis Samaras, Bank of Greece Governor Yannis Stournaras and the EU’s Migration Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos.
All politicians have denied the allegations claiming that it’s a government’s fabrication against its political rivals. Some of them have also sued the protected witnesses and prosecutors, as well as current Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras.
The Novartis investigation was launched in mid-December 2016 with evidence of bribery of thousands of state officials and doctors to obtain preferential treatment in the market for Novartis.
The Greek probe followed a two-year investigation conducted by US authorities on the methods Novartis allegedly used to prevail in the market.
It is estimated that the cash-strapped country has lost approximately €3 billion due to the scandal.



Pharma scandal whips up political storm in Greek opposition ranks
A probe into illegal practices of Swiss drugmaker Novartis in Greece, involving thousands of state officials and doctors, has opened the Pandora’s Box in Greek politics as local media have named ten former bigwigs from opposition parties as being targeted by the investigation.


Tsipras: Was it a ‘natural phenomenon’
Leftist Premier Alexis Tsipras emphasised that the investigation will proceed and justice will be done. The main opposition New Democracy party abstained from the vote.
Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the leader of New Democracy party, admitted that the scandal exists and was global though it was not revealed by the government but by the US authorities.
“We need to learn the truth, punish those involved and ask for money from the company for the damage. But you do not do that, Mr Tsipras […] you used the case to hurt your political opponents,” Mitsotakis said.
Mitsotakis also noted that the wider picture of the situation should be taken into account. “Today’s debate does not take place at a politically neutral time. We are at a crucial moment. The stability in the Southeast Mediterranean is at stake.”
“As long as there is a scandal, how did this happen? Was it a natural phenomenon? Who is to blame for this?” Tsipras wondered.
“For this scandal of mismanagement that caused huge damage to the Greek state, is there political responsibility?” the leftist prime minister commented, adding that such a big scandal is impossible to happen without the political leadership being aware of that.
Novartis has said that it is cooperating closely with the authorities on the case. In an interview with Kathimerini newspaper, Novartis Hellas boss Susanne Kohout said that the leaks of the case file “undermine” the ongoing investigation.
Asked whether Konstantinos Frouzis, who served as vice president of Novartis Greece and appears in the case file, bribed politicians, she replied:
“First of all, I do not know Mr Frouzis – I took over last May, long after he left. Secondly, if what has been described in the case-file actually happened, it is completely contrary to the company’s code of conduct. Thirdly, practically speaking, I do not know where he could find the cash from the company to do what they attribute to him. I would be surprised, therefore, if these things really took place.”



Greek judges call for calm over Novartis scandal
The Greek Union of Judges and Prosecutors called for “calmness and sobriety” on Friday (16 February), following a lawsuit by former Prime Minister Antonis Samaras against Premier Alexis Tsipras and Prosecutor of Corruption Eleni Touloupaki over the Novartis scandal.

                The former European Commissioner Emma Bonino returns to the Italian political scene for the upcoming general election with the +Europa coalition, and the aim of removing “the danger” of the far right and the Five Star Movement. EURACTIV’s partner Euroefe reports.
In an interview with the Spanish news agency EFE, Bonino, leader of the Italian Radical Party, voiced her concerns regarding the emergence in Europe of parties like the Lega Nord, a coalition partner of Forza Italia, the centre-right party led by Silvio Berlusconi, and the Five Star Movement (M5S).
While Berlusconi defends his Lega Nord partner Matteo Salvini and says the threat lies with the M5S, Bonino is clear on one thing: both are dangerous.
“If they end up governing (Lega Nord and M5S), it would be dangerous because what they say they want to do is totally contrary to the democratic and human development of a great continent like Europe,” she said.
At almost 70 years of age and having overcome cancer that has kept her away from politics for a long time, Emma Bonino presents her movement in coalition with Matteo Renzi’s Democratic Party (PD). Both defend the EU in an election campaign where the issue has virtually disappeared.
She confirms her decision to side with Matteo Renzi, as it responds to the need to prevent at all costs a victory by “this sovereigntist, anti-European and xenophobic bloc represented by Berlusconi, Salvini and Meloni”. [Giorgia Meloni, leader of the far-right Brothers of Italy party]
She regards the Five Star Movement as “a mysterious object”, as it constantly changes its mind about the EU, and she also accuses it of “not having an institutional vocation or culture”.
European Commissioner for consumer policy and fisheries between 1994 and 1999, Bonino confided in EFE her wish to return to the European political scene.
“There is still time” for her to occupy one of the highest institutional positions. Her name has also been mentioned as a candidate for the post of Italy’s president.



+Europa candidate: Italy risks departing from basic EU values
The stakes are high for Italy ahead of the vote on 4 March, as it runs the risk of becoming yet another EU country that departs from basic European values such as the rule of law, candidate Alberto Alemanno told EURACTIV.


Xenophobic climate
According to her, Europe’s problem is that in 2011, faced with the economic crisis, we found out that “we did not have a bank or treasury, we did not have a budget minister. The storm broke and we found out that we did not have an umbrella, so we settled for national solutions that were somewhat improvised. ”
Her solution for the EU is “a federal and federalist Europe”. With a governance structure that treats the single currency with more transparency, democracy and resources to develop social, investment and innovation policies for young people.
A major problem is that there are no more “pan-European parties,” said the former foreign minister in the government of Enrico Letta in 2013.
“In some countries, like mine, Europe has long been used as a scapegoat and held responsible for everything that is wrong, which is false,” she stated.
One of her points in common with Matteo Renzi, with whom she admits having had little contact, is therefore the defence of Europe.
“If something goes wrong, then Europe is to blame and, to put it bluntly, we suddenly forget all the economic benefits, the opportunity to travel, Erasmus, the lack of roaming fees, low-cost flights … “, she added.
She said that since her political debut at the age of 27, she has never seen an election campaign with “as many far-fetched promises” as the current one.
She also warned that although Italy “is not racist”, a “xenophobic climate is taking hold”, which she finds worrying.
Bonino also argued that there is no immigration problem, the main theme of the electoral campaign, and that “good management of unregistered migrants” would suffice.
For now, Bonino does not want to make plans for the future and prefers not to predict what will happen in March. She hopes only to be able to exceed the 3% threshold that would guarantee +Europa about 12 to 15 seats and allow her to take her fight back to the Italian parliament.

                Theresa May gathered her ministers for yet another unfortunately titled Brexit ‘war cabinet’ at her country retreat on Thursday. Nobody in Brussels is holding their breath. Nor do May’s ministers appear to be in any great hurry to agree on a long-awaited negotiating position.
Yet time is not the UK’s friend.
This week’s ‘non-dispute’ over the precise length of the transition period – the EU says 21 months, the UK potentially wants longer, maybe) is an indication that UK ministers know that the clock is against them.
A letter to Brexit Secretary David Davis by Hillary Benn, who chairs the UK Parliament’s Exiting the EU committee, on Thursday (22 February) warns of the “urgent need now to provide more detail on the government’s plans”.
“If this does not happen, then there is a risk that either the start of negotiations on the future relationship will be delayed or that the EU’s negotiating guidelines may close off options,” it adds.
That these acute time pressures exist is largely because of the UK Prime Minister’s biggest tactical blunder – starting the Article 50 process last March, long before she was ready. Ministers had not agreed on what they wanted from the talks: a year on they still haven’t .
The civil service was not prepared. Even now, officials are groaning under an impossible weight of expectation to deliver the undeliverable.
The decision on when to start the Article 50 process – and start the two year ticking clock – was one of two trump cards held by London, the other being EU budget contributions. It was given up for nothing.
The ability to cut third party trade deals has been repeatedly cited by David Davis et al as the main reason for requesting a transition rather than delaying the exit date.
Yet civil servants and Westminster-insiders privately concede that these mythical trade deals, including the chief unicorn of them all: a UK-US pact, are many years away.
“This was obviously never possible,” a Westminster-based trade analyst tells EURACTIV. “They’ll do their best to mitigate the damage,” he says of beleaguered UK civil servants.
There is also strife between Crawford Falconer, the UK’s chief trade negotiator, and Olly Robbins, May’s Brexit advisor.
“Falconer though he would be leading on Brexit only to find that he is having his letters thrown in the bin by Olly Robbins,” a Westminster source tells EURACTIV.
May attempted a Brexit relaunch last week. But that is rather hard when your ministers who have been touring European capitals still do not have a detailed Brexit position to sell to their counterparts.
The sensible thing would be for the UK to request an extension to the Article 50 process. That would spare the EU, but particularly the UK negotiating team, from having to meet a near-impossible deadline.
But that, alas, appears to be politically impossible for a painfully weak and tactically inept prime minister.
The Roundup
Ahead of tomorrow’s informal summit, French President Macron eyes gaining the upper hand on the appointment of the next Commission president, if the implementation of transnational lists for the 2019 European elections does not pan out as he wishes.
A UK government paper on the ‘Implementation Period’ leaked, indicating that Theresa May’s government is preparing to re-open talks about the length of the transition period after the UK formally leaves the EU.
Stakes are high for Italy ahead of the general elections on 4 March as the country runs the risk of departing from basic European values such as the rule of law, candidate Alberto Alemanno told EURACTIV in an interview.
Meanwhile, former European Commissioner Emma Bonino returns to the Italian political scene for the upcoming general election with the +Europa coalition, and the aim of removing “the danger” of the far right and the Five Star Movement.
The air is getting thick once again as the Court of Justice ruled that Poland has infringed air quality laws, paving the way for further penalties and prolonging Warsaw’s ongoing spat with Brussels.
Macedonia is making headway in its bid to join the EU, German Chancellor Merkel said, praising recent reforms by Skopje and the prospect of settling its chronic name dispute with Greece.
The US urged Albania to avoid “careless language” after its prime minister suggested a single president and single security policy for both his country and neighbouring Kosovo in a speech that infuriated Serbia.
In the land of wine, a recent study published by the French NGO Générations Future hit the nerve when revealing that 89% of grape samples were contaminated by pesticides. Pesticide residues were found in samples from 19 fruit and 33 vegetables.
Public health leaders warn that Brexit negotiations mean health risks are being forgotten, potentially delaying the availability of new medicines and imposing large costs on manufacturers.
Parliament is exploring ways to convert the younger generation’s online engagement into higher turnout in the upcoming elections, write MEPs Ramón Luis Valcárcel and Sylvie Guillaume.
And Germany’s influence over the EU is clearly already paying off after yesterday’s news, as the latest decision by the bloc’s top court clearly shows…

                Closed pan-European lists would be a game changer in how European citizens identify with EU politics, write Angelos Chryssogelos and Malgorzata Staniaszek.
Dr Angelos Chryssogelos teaches European politics at the Department of European and International Studies, King’s College London. Malgorzata Staniaszek is an EU and competition law expert.
On 7 February, the European Parliament endorsed the Spitzenkandidaten procedure for the 2019 European elections. European party families will put forward candidates for European Commission president. The procedure is not legally enshrined in EU treaties, but it was used in 2014 and MEPs expect that national leaders will accept its outcome again.
In 2014 the winner, the European People’s Party candidate Jean-Claude Juncker, was indeed appointed Commission president.
In the same vote, however, MEPs rejected the creation of transnational lists to fill some of the 73 UK seats expected to be left vacant after Brexit. It was always uncertain that transnational lists would be accepted by national leaders, who must approve of any changes.
But the failure of the Parliament to endorse transnational lists was a big missed opportunity to promote real EU-level party democracy. If the EU proceeds with Spitzenkandidaten in 2019, it is going to be as flat an affair as in 2014. The EU has gotten the order of things wrong: Spitzenkandidaten will energize European elections only if combined with transnational lists.
Opponents of transnational lists argue that they would create a class of parliamentarians far removed from the electorate, as citizens are used to electing MEPs on a national basis. Transnational MEPs would also increase national divides. Candidates from larger member-states would have an advantage over candidates from smaller ones trying to win votes across a mega-constituency of hundreds of millions of voters.
These arguments are not convincing. First, it is unclear why electing one person across the EU – the Commission president – brings the EU closer to its citizens, but electing 30 or 40 MEPs would alienate them. Second, electing MEPs at different levels of the EU polity in no way means that some will be first-class in relation to others.
The status of members of a parliament is determined by that parliament’s mode of operation, not the level at which its members are elected. European elections have always been contested at different levels anyway. MEPs in some countries are elected nationally, in others in sub-national constituencies.
The most erroneous charge waged against transnational lists is that they would fail to increase the ideological character of European elections and deepen national divides. This would be true only if European voters could express their preference on the names on each Europarty’s list, i.e. if the MEPs of the pan-European constituency were elected through an open list system.
In that case, it would be natural for German voters of the EPP ballot to vote overwhelmingly for the German names, the Greeks for the Greek ones, and so on for each country and party list.
But this problem could be avoided if Europarties presented closed lists of candidates for the pan-European constituency, i.e. if they pre-ordered the candidates and the overall number of votes the Europarty would gain across the EU determined how many names on the list were elected. In such a system, voters would be voting not for names on the ballot, but for Europarties as such.
The experience of the nation-state is instructive here. Most modern European states initially were fragmented along linguistic, religious etc. lines. The homogenization of European societies was completed by political parties that campaigned nationally and offered voters the same menu of choices on issues of national importance.
European societies really became national only when party systems encompassed whole countries, turning citizens of states into voters of national party systems.
In the same way, closed pan-European lists would be a game-changer in how European citizens identify with EU politics. Next to their usual choice between national parties, voters would be faced with a second ballot-box for casting a vote on their preferred Europarty. This would be a decisive step towards the creation of transnational party identification among voters.
This would also be strengthened by European citizens for the first time seeing election results reported on a European scale, as these would be necessary to distribute the number of pan-European seats among Europarties. The power of European party families has always been measured by the number of their EP seats as aggregation of their member-parties’ results. This made European elections a sum of national elections, not a true European political contest.
EU politicians’ hope that electing the Union’s ‘president’ will unite the European electorate reflects a faulty reading of the historical development of party democracy in Europe. It was not the centralization of authority that united national societies, but the mobilizing and socializing effect of uniform party competition across a whole country.
For as long as voters in European elections vote for national parties in national settings, instead of European parties at the EU level, it will make little difference whether this is linked with the election of the president of a far-flung institution. EU democracy will remain the aggregate of 27 national democracies.
The Spitzenkandidaten procedure is an important step toward democratizing the EU. But on its own, it has little capacity to engage national electorates used to voting for national parties. European voters must begin to think of the EU as a party democracy, just like member-states are.
Being able to vote directly for a Europarty would allow voters for the first time to think of European elections as a contest between European, as opposed to national, parties. By failing to endorse the transnational list idea, MEPs and national leaders are deferring the emergence of a European party democracy to 2024 and beyond.

                This article is part of our special report Europe’s mayors: Speeding up the energy transition.The city of Wrocław is one of Poland’s success stories, where job creation has hit record highs and environmental objectives are taken seriously. Wrocław’s long-serving mayor revealed his city’s future-leaning path and the advantages of being part of a Europe-wide network of mayors.
Rafał Dutkiewicz has been the mayor of Wrocław since 2002. He was voted Poland’s best mayor four years running.
He spoke with EURACTIV’s Sam Morgan on the sidelines of the Covenant of Mayors 10th-anniversary celebrations, held in Brussels on 22 February.
Your city signed up to the Covenant of Mayors in 2016. What impact has that had since?
As civilisation is now more and more concentrated in big cities, there is a global tendency to connect culture with mayors. What we are trying to do is go more in this direction. But cities in Eastern and Central Europe, like those in Poland, are only on the first level. We have to deal more with air quality than energy issues.
Energy should be the next step but, at the beginning, we have to tackle smog as it is our biggest problem. Air quality in Wrocław has improved twofold over the last decade. We still have work to do but we have spent EU money trying to reduce energy demand.
What is really interesting though is a shift towards increasing public participation and really utilising direct democracy.
Does EU money arrive where it is actually needed or does the procedure need improving?
There is a certain problem, which is always connected to public money, because it creates a lot of bureaucracy. On the one hand, yes it is needed because we’re talking about taxpayer money but, on the other, it is so difficult to describe how money has actually been spent. Add to that the fact that Polish bureaucracy is perhaps even more unwieldy than its European counterpart, and you see how complex the process is.
But EU funds are an additional resource only. Money is crucial, yes, but its main impact has been to broaden our horizons and imagination. Just having money on the table to work towards certain goals made us think more about the goals themselves, which has raised standards. Joining the EU was obviously crucial in that regard.



Poland critical of linking EU funds to rule of law
The European Commission’s proposal to link EU budget funds to the rule of law was seen as putting Brussels on a collision course with Poland. Jean-Claude Juncker recognised that there is a chance for rapprochement in the dispute with Warsaw. EURACTIV Poland reports.


So an instrument like the Covenant of Mayors is a way for you to explore that broadened imagination further?
Yes. But still, there are challenges. For our country, the economy and energy mix is still based on coal. It’s mainly an issue connected with the government but local authorities can try to push them in the right direction. Coal was nice but it belongs in the past.
Job generation in Lower Silesia, whose capital is your city, is very strong. But we often hear that coal has to remain a factor in Poland’s energy mix because of the employment it generates. How do those two things stack up?
It’s number one Europe-wide in generating jobs. A few years after joining the EU, Wrocław had about 700,000 people and a wider population of about 1 million. We have managed to generate a massive 400,000 new jobs since then due to a huge boom in the economy.
Leaving coal behind is going to take time. But we have no doubts that this change has to be made. Frankly speaking, there are two narratives here. Firstly, there is really strong and positive support for electro-mobility. But there is also the still powerful coal lobby, which has always had a place at the table.
In my opinion, what we need is time.



Brussels muddies waters on state aid for coal power
A European Commission decision on Wednesday (7 February) to approve state aid for emergency power plants – often gas or coal-fired – has been accused of complicating ongoing negotiations in the European Parliament.


You’ve been mayor for nearly 16 years. What have been your main challenges in that time?
We used to have too many heating systems that are fuelled by coal and it’s something we have to eliminate. We’ve had a lot of success in this challenge though, reducing the number from 90,000 individual heating points to the current level of 20,000. We’ve got to get rid of those too of course by introducing alternatives like electricity or gas.
You mentioned the strong support for electro-mobility in Poland. Is that true in Wrocław too?
The very first car-sharing system based solely on electric cars was introduced in Wrocław. We sweetened the deal by introducing certain privileges like access to the city centre. There is a strong tram service but we still need a better bus connection.
But the car-sharing scheme has been a huge success. Poland has far too many cars: in Wrocław, it is about 600 per 1,000 people, which is far too many. Car-sharing and using electric cars is a really positive way of getting that number down.



Polish exec: Electro-Mobility Act creates whole ecosystem for EVs
Poland formally adopted its first Electro-Mobility Act on Monday (5 February), a document branded as a new “constitution” for the development of electric cars and buses in the coal-dependent country.


Do you have much in common with other cities on issues like this or is it cross-border, with your Covenant of Mayors colleagues, where you have better communication?
Polish cities are very competitive with one another and public opinion is very much in favour of modernisation. This plays a positive role because we are pushing each other and that leads to progress.
Does what happens in Brussels matter at the city level? EU lawmaking is sometimes accused of not taking into account local level issues, even though it is at that very level where the benefits, and sometimes disadvantages, are most felt.
Generally speaking, there is a problem in Europe now with national states becoming more assertive. This is dangerous for the EU. The way of thinking in the EU used to be a regional one but now it is understood that cities are sexy.
A network of cities, like this one, is only going to become more important, so I really welcome the cooperation between the European Commission and the Covenant. Worldwide, the future is going to belong to cities. There will be advantages and disadvantages to that, so overcoming the gap put in place by national governments will be crucial.



EU calls on all cities to join Global Covenant of Mayors
The Commission’s Energy Union chief on Tuesday (27 June) urged all cities to join the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, an initiative which has gained more weight since Donald Trump announced the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on climate change.


Innovation Commissioner Carlos Moedas has put up €1 million for the winner of the Innovation Capital 2018 award. Will Wrocław be entering?
Well, we’re bidding for the European Green Capital. When José Manuel Barroso said many years ago that Europe needs to be innovative and that the EU would be setting up a technology institute, I immediately said that it should be in Wrocław. We only fell at the final hurdle, losing out to Budapest.
Universities, academia and open society are needed for innovation. That latter point needs an international society, which has only just started happening in Poland. Now, we have more and more people from more and more countries. I’m trying to support this, because by investing in culture and academia is only going to pay off in conjunction with that. Innovation soon follows after when you do.
COP24 will be held in Poland at the end of the year. It’s fair to say that your country does not have the best image at the moment…
Because of stupid people!
Could such a high-level event boost Poland’s image by showing that it should not be judged solely on what your national government does?
I must say that I am embarrassed by what is happening in Poland. The door to the country must be kept open and Katowice is a door through which world leaders will walk. Generally, I hope and am confident that our country will end up on the right track though.



COP24 in Katowice: Poland between reason and ambitions
Poland says it will focus on “common sense” at December’s UN Climate Summit. But following last month’s dismissal of environment minister Jan Szyszko, it currently has no chairman responsible for preparing the summit. EURACTIV Poland’s media partner WysokieNapiecie.pl reports.


            ","This article is part of our special report Europe’s mayors: Speeding up the energy transition.The city of Wrocław is one of Poland’s success stories, where job creation has hit record highs and environmental objectives are taken seriously. Wrocław’s long-serving mayor revealed his city’s future-leaning path and the advantages of being part of a Europe-wide network of mayors. Rafał Dutkiewicz has been the mayor of Wrocław since 2002. He was voted Poland’s best mayor four years running. He spoke with EURACTIV’s Sam Morgan on the sidelines of the Covenant of Mayors 10th-anniversary celebrations, held in Brussels on 22 February. Your city signed up to the Covenant of Mayors in 2016. What impact has that had since? As civilisation is now more and more concentrated in big cities, there is a global tendency to connect culture with mayors. What we are trying to do is go more in this direction. But cities in Eastern and Central Europe, like those in Poland, are only on the first level. We have to deal more with air quality than energy issues. Energy should be the next step but, at the beginning, we have to tackle smog as it is our biggest problem. Air quality in Wrocław has improved twofold over the last decade. We still have work to do but we have spent EU money trying to reduce energy demand. What is really interesting though is a shift towards increasing public participation and really utilising direct democracy. Does EU money arrive where it is actually needed or does the procedure need improving? There is a certain problem, which is always connected to public money, because it creates a lot of bureaucracy. On the one hand, yes it is needed because we’re talking about taxpayer money but, on the other, it is so difficult to describe how money has actually been spent. Add to that the fact that Polish bureaucracy is perhaps even more unwieldy than its European counterpart, and you see how complex the process is. But EU funds are an additional resource only. Money is crucial, yes, but its main impact has been to broaden our horizons and imagination. Just having money on the table to work towards certain goals made us think more about the goals themselves, which has raised standards. Joining the EU was obviously crucial in that regard. Poland critical of linking EU funds to rule of law The European Commission’s proposal to link EU budget funds to the rule of law was seen as putting Brussels on a collision course with Poland. Jean-Claude Juncker recognised that there is a chance for rapprochement in the dispute with Warsaw. EURACTIV Poland reports.

                EU leaders have dealt a blow to the controversial Spitzenkandidat system of electing a European Commission president, setting themselves up for a fight with the European Parliament. The rift between Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and European Council chief Donald Tusk deepened as the two officials clashed over the process.
Leaders from 27 member states do not want to repeat the process that put current Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in office after next year’s European elections. They rejected the Spitzenkandidat system at a meeting in Brussels on Friday (23 February). British Prime Minister Theresa May did not attend.
Under the Spitzenkandidat process, the top Commission job goes to the lead candidate from the pan-EU political party that receives the most votes in European Parliament elections.
MEPs back the system and passed a resolution earlier this month that threatened to reject any nominee for Commission president who does not stand in next year’s election as a party’s lead candidate. They argue the process is more democratic because candidates campaign throughout the EU so that citizens know who they elect.



MEPs and EU leaders on collision course over Spitzenkandidaten process
MEPs are ready to pick a fight with EU leaders and reject any candidate for EU Commission president who is not voted for by the European electorate after a transparent and open process, like in the 2014 elections.


Juncker came to power after his centre-right European People’s Party won a majority in 2014. That was the only time the Spitzenkandidat process has been tested.
But heads of state do not want to use the system again because it would take away their power to nominate a candidate themselves.
European Council President Donald Tusk used sharp words to express his disapproval of the method to choose a Commission chief.
“The idea that the Spitzenkandidat process is somehow more democratic is wrong,” Tusk said after the meeting on Friday.
He said every leader agreed that the European Council “cannot guarantee in advance that it can propose one of the lead candidates for president of the Commission. There is no automaticity in this process.”
Tusk—and the heads of state he represents—have taken issue with the Parliament’s demand for an automatic appointment of the winning party’s candidate. But while Tusk does not want a guarantee, he said it is still possible, and even helpful, if the politician who is chosen as Commission president was a party’s leading candidate.
He does not want to promise that the European election outcome will determine the next president, which would mean giving up heads of state’s power to veto the nominee. Instead, the 27 heads of state should nominate a candidate themselves and secure “double democratic legitimacy” through MEPs’ approval afterwards, Tusk said.
The Council chief did not shy away from a public spat with Juncker over what “automatic” means. The two presidents spoke to reporters while sharing a stage at a news conference.
Tusk and Juncker have a history of public disagreements, clashing at earlier summits over the Nordstream gas pipeline and repeatedly over migration. The squabble over how to replace Juncker when his term ends in 2019 only added to the tensions between them.
“I do think the treaty is very clear. The treaty is not describing a process of automaticity,” Juncker responded, speaking after Tusk.
The heads of state and MEPs disagree because the Spitzenkandidat process is not written into EU treaties. That leaves room for interpretation, and lawyers for the Commission and the Council disagree over whether the treaties will need to change for the process to be set into stone.
The treaties’ guidance on choosing a Commission president is thin: the European Council must “take into account” the outcome of the European elections when they nominate a candidate.
Tusk appeared to belittle the discussion over the process as “very much a Brussels bubble topic”.
Juncker responded by describing a list of his other proposals to shake up the Commission, and recent organisational changes he made to move his former chief of staff Martin Selmayr into the job of Commission secretary general.
“In the Brussels bubble these things are pretty major,” he said.
Heads of state agreed unanimously that they do not want to guarantee that the Spitzenkandidat will become Commission president, but they did not get into lengthy discussions over institutional workings and EU treaties in their comments at the end of Friday’s meeting.



Seeking post-Brexit unity, EU leaders find more fights
EU leaders face difficult talks this week on the thorny issues of how to plug holes in the post-Brexit budget and choose a successor for European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker.


One EU official explained before the meeting that the leaders’ public criticism of the process would likely be muted.
“We don’t think that’s what Europe really needs today, to have a deep tension with the European Parliament,” the source said.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel backed up Tusk’s objection, telling reporters that the Spitzenkandidat process “cannot become a complete automatism”.
She said the leaders did not discuss whether they should nominate another sitting head of state to take over Juncker’s job next year.
Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite tweeted before the meeting, “Don’t count your Spitzens before they hatch. #EuropeanParliament election still a year away.”


Don't count your Spitzens before they hatch. #EuropeanParliament election still a year away #EUCO
— Dalia Grybauskaitė (@Grybauskaite_LT) February 23, 2018

French President Emmanuel Macron also criticised the process.
The EU source said one reason leaders are reluctant to pin the Commission presidency on European elections is that the political landscape is shifting in a number of member states, with extreme groups gaining more support.
“There are so many unknown elements in this equation that to speculate now would be really premature,” the official said.
It would be “very unreasonable and irrational” if leaders guarantee that a Spitzenkandidat from the winning political party in next year’s election would end up as president, the source added.
But MEPs are holding their ground.
Manfred Weber, the German MEP who leads the European People’s Party in the Parliament, doubled down on the house’s resolution.
“People should know before the election who can become the President of the European Commission. Everything else would throw Europe far back to the days of backroom diplomacy,” Weber said in a statement on Friday.
European Parliament President Antonio Tajani called the Spitzenkandidat system a “proposal to reinforce democracy”. He lashed out at the Council’s preference for leaders to nominate a candidate themselves.
“We don’t want a bureaucratic Europe,” he said.
MEPs could still reject the European Council’s nominee when they propose a new president next year.

                The European Union is in need of a rebranding. Giles Merritt suggests ways the European Commission can go about doing that while helping save the European project.
Giles Merritt is the founder and chairman of Friends of Europe. This opinion piece was first published on that organisation’s website.
There was a fleeting moment almost fifteen years ago when it seemed that the European Commission was going to take its image problems in hand. “Call me Joe,” said its jovial new president José Manuel Barroso, signalling at his first press conference what many hoped would be a revolution in the way ‘Brussels’ is seen.
Joe gave the job of chief revolutionary to one of the rising stars of his incoming Commission, Sweden’s Margot Wallström. That, too, suggested an imminent upheaval in how the EU communicates. As we know, that was not to be.
Wallström initiated a slew of studies and high-powered working groups, but the portfolio her fellow Commissioners had at first envied turned out to be a poisoned chalice. It wasn’t that anyone deliberately torpedoed her ambitious ideas, merely that they were stifled by the Commission’s own culture.
Most of the Commission’s business is confidential, whether it’s with governments, companies or NGOs. So it’s hard for eurocrats who have many of them trained as lawyers or economists to turn themselves into PRs. Hard, but essential.
The Euroscepticism that increasingly pervades Europe’s politics owes to the EU’s failure to communicate. That wouldn’t matter if being unpopular concerned only the often arcane workings of the EU, but it now threatens the wider cause of European integration.
What’s the answer then ‒ how does a bureaucracy turn itself into a persuasive and trustworthy loud-hailer? It’s actually not that difficult, but the first step, arguably the hardest, is for the Commission to stop doing what it does.
Barroso’s promised communications revolution delivered more but not better information. Each Directorate-General gained its own information unit, and these stepped up the flow of brochures and press releases to their sector, which of course means their own clientele. They also became machines for cranking out career-boosting material for their particular Commissioner.
The far more important task of explaining “what is the EU for?” was sidestepped, and still is. Anyone who receives the specialised outpourings of the various DGs is already well aware of what the EU does. But nine-tenths of the European electorate most certainly don’t know.
The European Parliament’s secretariat is on the right track with its more imaginative approach to information and multi-media. But selling ‘democracy’ is easier than repackaging red tape. So here’s what the Commission should do that would truly rebrand it and help save the European project.
First, stop pumping out ‘good news’. Trumpeting achievements rarely tell much of the problems that were overcome. Strange as it may sound, the EU’s worth is better explained by highlighting difficulties, even when that involves bad news. Where possible, Brussels should name and shame opponents of ‘European’ solutions.
Second, tear up all those brochures. They clutter corridors and are almost always a waste of money. And re-think the framework contracts the big consultancies are so fond of and that protect eurocrats from criticism. They create an unhealthy relationship in which consultants pander to ‘the client’ and avoid innovations that risk conflicting with Commission officials’ prejudices.
Third, go out and hire journalists and social media experts as commission officials, not just part-timers. They may make a hash of the Concours but they know what works and what doesn’t, and they’re more likely to defy the hierarchy. They also know there’s no such person as ‘a European’, so effective communication can only be in the different national idioms.
Fourth, on media relations, stop thinking that serving the Brussels-based EU-accredited press corps does the job. Their specialist knowledge is impressive, but they have little influence on public opinion. Aim instead for columnists and commentators, and take regional and local media far more seriously.
Fifth, find a new symbol ‒ the blue flag and Ode to Joy aren’t enough, in contrast to messages, where there are too many. They compete and confuse. What’s needed is something eye-catching and instantly recognisable, comparable to the logos of the Internet giants.
Aim above all for children as tomorrow’s voters, and devise ‘European civics’ teaching kits in all the official languages to be distributed to secondary schools. If any member governments block that, name them ‒ that would make a really good story!

                EXCLUSIVE / In a wide-ranging interview, the minister of foreign affairs and European integration of Moldova, Tudor Ulianovschi, talks about his country’s relations with the EU and Moscow, the political situation ahead of crucial elections, and the prospects for frozen conflicts in Transnistria as well as other issues.
Tudor Ulianovschi is the minister for foreign affairs and European integration of the Republic of Moldova. He is a career diplomat and has served in Washington and Qatar. 
He spoke to EURACTIV’s Senior Editor Georgi Gotev.
What brings you to Brussels? 
Yesterday was a very important day for Moldova’s EU path. We had a good meeting, in the morning, of the so–called group of friends of Moldova, followed by the Foreign Affairs Council. One of the agenda items of the Foreign affairs council was the Republic of Moldova and yesterday in the evening we had a good evening with Federica Mogherini where we also debated and discussed the future of Moldova –  EU relations.
Your country will hold elections this year, but is the date set?
At this point, we are looking towards the end of November or perhaps the beginning of December. The precise date would be decided in the near future by the parliament of the Republic of Moldova.
In the Council conclusions of yesterday’s ministerial meeting, I notice regret that the new electoral law does not address key recommendations of the Venice Commission and so on. How would you comment?
In our opinion, the majority of the recommendations of the Venice Commission were taken into consideration. At the same time, the Moldovan parliament following the internal consultation with various stakeholders also from the civil society has decided to adopt the new electoral code that includes the new system of elections, a mixed system, based on the party lists and on the uninominal circumscriptions.
But this translates into an advantage for the two largest parties and disadvantages for the smaller parties. 
That is one way, perhaps of looking at that. On the other hand, in my opinion, it is good that the regions or the “raions” of the Republic of Moldova will have the opportunity to delegate and to elect their own representatives from the “raions” to be elected in a position of a member of the Parliament. In this case, there will be a direct responsibility of that elected official towards a certain region of the Republic of Moldova so hopefully – and this is my understanding – that the responsibility and accountability of particular MPs but also the Parliament in general, will increase.
Moldova gives the impression of a divided country also because the president is pro –Russian, the government is pro-European and pro-western, you yourself are pro-European and pro-western. Do you think that at some point Moldova will have a less ambiguous and clearer pro-European positioning?
I will tell you like this. Number one, I am a clear pro–European, pro-Westerner. Number two, I think the Republic of Moldova has reached the point of no return in its European integration path.
From this perspective, I think that what is most important for us is to ensure the implementation of the Association Agreement between the Republic of Moldova and the European Union, which at this point, would allow the Republic of Moldova to have better institutions, better economic development, and therefore from the perspective of which model of development, or which model of the future development of the Republic of Moldova is more beneficial for its citizens.
And now I speak also as a citizen of the Republic of Moldova. When I go to the European Union, when I visit EU member states, I see a model of structuring the government, the model of the development of the democratic institutions, I think that this model is the one that should be applied for the Republic of Moldova, for its future.
And this is important, also to understand that the European model of development is not only beneficial to the government, but for the citizens of the Republic of Moldova. And this is where, I think is important, to better communicate to the citizens of the Republic of Moldova, being in a very dynamic geopolitical context, geopolitical environment.
We have been a part of the Soviet Union, we have been independent for 26 years, that is why it is important for the government to help the Moldovan citizens make their own decisions.
But they have to have access to the European format of development, the European format of democracy, and to have access of information, and this is where the task of the government is to better inform the Moldovan citizens of the advantages provided by the EU integration.
And also, if we look at the opinion polls, the majority today in Moldova are showing a preference towards the EU that has to be sustained by the efforts of the Moldovan government to better implement the reforms, to restructure the justice sector reform, to fight corruption, and this would also, in my opinion, will further increase.
I read the speech of your prime minister at the Munich security conference. He made the point that the same division I was telling you about Moldova exists in many of the eastern European countries. Of course, many of them are already EU members but the same problems exist. Being from Eastern Europe myself, I think he has a point: Probably Moldova would like to have the same chances like those countries, despite those divisions, which are the result of historical circumstances. What is your take?
I think that looking at the Republic of Moldova from the perspective of the division of the spheres of influence is a wrong approach, it is not a constructive approach. The best approach is to speak from the perspective of the Republic of Moldova and its sovereignty. The sovereignty of the Republic of Moldova or any country whatsoever relies on the fact that a country decides for itself where it wants to be.
I was also at the Munich security conference, accompanying the prime minister Pavel Filip, who has stated very clearly, that the Republic of Moldova has good relations with the West and also good relations with the East, and with the Russian Federation.
But, in our opinion, the main foreign policy priority is European integration of the Republic of Moldova and it doesn’t contradict the current format of participation of the Republic of Moldova in the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) region as well.
So from this perspective, I think it’s very important to understand that we should not speak of a zero-sum game, we should speak of a win-win perspective, having in mind that the political choice of the Moldovan people is European Integration, but the economic choice should be focused both onto the East, and onto the West.
When I speak to Russian diplomats, they say that, unlike others, Moldova has not adopted sanctions against Russia in the same way as countries in the EU orbit have. Are you under pressure from Mogherini or from other representatives of the European Union to introduce sanctions?
No, we cannot speak of any pressure from the European partners and from Madame Mogherini at all, to impose any sanctions in relation to the Russian Federation. On the contrary, unfortunately, the Russian Federation was imposing certain trade barriers to imports of Moldovan products.
In our opinion, the fact that we are facing the vast majority of Moldovan products not being allowed to enter the Russian Federation markets, especially the Moldovan wine and other agricultural products, is a violation of the bilateral agreement between the Republic of Moldova and the Russian Federation on the free trade.
Also, in our opinion it violates the Republic of Moldova and CIS free trade agreement, and on top of that, in our opinion, being both the Republic of Moldova and the Russian Federation members of the WTO, we do not think that these actions from the Russian Federation by imposing limitations or barriers to import from the Republic of Moldova are in line with the Russian Federation’s commitments to the WTO.
So, I would say on the contrary, the Republic of Moldova would like to have normal economic relations with the Russian Federation but we are yet to see a more open policy from Moscow.
Is this the main problem? I mean, when I look at the type of relations Moldova has with the EU, what triggers this Russian attitude? The Association agreement, the DCFTA?
Unfortunately, we see a historical consecutivity on the imposing by the Russian Federation of barriers to trade for Moldovan products, and this was first seen when the action plan between the Republic of Moldova and the EU was adopted in 2005 and at that time it was a huge blow to the Moldovan economy, to the Moldovan exports, because at that time we were exporting a lot of our goods to the Russian Federation, and after this EU-Moldova action plan was signed, we have seen an embargo from the Russian Federation. Well, at that time it was a good lesson for us to diversify our export direction…
Have you been successful?
Well, I can give you some numbers now. At this point today, and I think, thanks to the EU-Moldovan association agreement and the deep and comprehensive free trade agreement (DCFTA), today the EU is Moldova’s main export and trading partner. We have 65% of Moldovan goods being exported to the European Union market, and Romania is now Moldova’s largest trading partner.
So from this perspective, I think that the Republic of Moldova has even greater potential to increase their exports to the EU market but also we would like to have normal trade relations with the Russian Federation.
But unfortunately, these limitations from the Russian Federation occurred soon after or perhaps of a misunderstanding of the fact that the DCFTA does not contradict the Republic of Moldova’s relationship, economic relationship, with the Russian Federation.
And in our opinion, this DCFTA not only should, but is complementary to Moldova’s FTA with the CIS countries, and with the Russian Federation.
The Ministers yesterday adopted a text which is calling on your country to be more decisive in the fight against corruption. I am thinking about this extraordinary case where one billion euros or dollars disappeared from a bank. I know that a very expensive western company was hired to investigate, but I haven’t heard of any results. Can you update us?
Indeed, the finalisation of the investigation of the banking fraud that occurred in the Republic of Moldova is a priority for the government and for the law enforcement agencies.
At the same time, the Kroll company has been hired to assist us in investigating the banking fraud. The summary of their second Kroll report has been made public. In the month of March, we will have a visit to the Republic of Moldova from the experts from the Kroll company and we will have a discussion with this company in order to have the full picture and to have the details from the investigation. So the Republic of Moldova together with international partners, but also with certain EU member states can have a relationship that will help us to have the full picture on the one hand, and to finalise the process of the recovery of the assets lost.
With regards to the fight against corruption, I would like to inform you of a positive development in the sense that a new national integrity authority was set up in the Republic of Moldova. It now has a director and a deputy director. It is now in the process of recruiting the so-called integrity experts, or inspectors, 40+ people, and we envision that by the end of March, perhaps beginning of April, the recruitment process will finalise so that in April the integrity inspectors being charged with examination of the declarations of assets of judges, of the appointed and elected officials, will start their work and we envision that by July the national integrity authority will become fully operational.
When I interviewed your prime minister Pavel Filip a few months ago, he was quite optimistic about the Transnistria conflict. Can you update us on this?



Moldovan PM: The time of frozen conflicts has passed
The Prime Minister of Moldova Pavel Filip told EURACTIV.com in an exclusive interview that there are good prospects for finding a solution to the Transnistria conflict, one of the post-Soviet frozen conflicts which have caused enormous harm to the region’s populations.


Indeed, the end of 2017 was an optimistic one, mainly because in the context of the Austrian [OSCE] chairmanship there were reached 5 decisions, 5 protocols, with relationship to the confidence-building measures promoted between Chisinau and Tiraspol.
This year in 2018 we have already had two good progresses in relation to the Latin-based script schools in the Transnistria region in the Republic of Moldova, the activity of the Gura Bicului bridge, which now needs to have a better infrastructure. There are ongoing discussions with relationship to setting up telecommunications, but also with relationship to car license plates for vehicles from the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova.
There is a political will in Chisinau to move forward with these discussions, with these confidence-building measures. There is a, in my opinion, a good dialogue with the representatives from Tiraspol.
At this point, perhaps it would be good if our European partners and the EU itself would further encourage the authorities of Tiraspol to be more flexible and pragmatic, in the sense of finalising these discussions on the two topics that I have mentioned, so that we can have these decisions adopted in the near future. Because, let’s speak very openly, they would be to the benefit of the citizens of the Republic of Moldova, be it in the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova, and all the others.
Because we need to have a better people-to-people contact, we need to ensure the direct contact between all sides and this will create the necessary prerequisite to the confidence-building measures on the one side, and will also slowly bring us slowly closer to a potential future political settlement of the conflict.
So I wouldn’t say that I am optimistic, I am encouraged by the positive developments in the 5+2 talks [involving Russia, Ukraine, the OSCE, Moldova, Transnistria, as well as the US and the EU], at the end of last year, and now it’s very important to make the current negotiation process on the confidence-building measures sustainable and orientated towards results.

There is a political will in Chisinau to move forward with these discussions, with these confidence-building measures. There is a, in my opinion, a good dialogue with the representatives from Tiraspol. At this point, perhaps it would be good if our European partners and the EU itself would further encourage the authorities of Tiraspol to be more flexible and pragmatic, in the sense of finalising these discussions on the two topics that I have mentioned, so that we can have these decisions adopted in the near future. Because, let’s speak very openly, they would be to the benefit of the citizens of the Republic of Moldova, be it in the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova, and all the others. Because we need to have a better people-to-people contact, we need to ensure the direct contact between all sides and this will create the necessary prerequisite to the confidence-building measures on the one side, and will also slowly bring us slowly closer to a potential future political settlement of the conflict. So I wouldn’t say that I am optimistic, I am encouraged by the positive developments in the 5+2 talks [involving Russia, Ukraine, the OSCE, Moldova, Transnistria, as well as the US and the EU], at the end of last year, and now it’s very important to make the current negotiation process on the confidence-building measures sustainable and orientated towards results.",92

                The EU is a community of shared values, the minister of state for Europe in the German Foreign Office, Michael Roth (SPD), emphasised in an interview with EURACTIV’s media partner “Der Tagesspiegel“, referring to the anti-Soros campaign in Hungary and the rule of law infringement procedure against Poland.
Michael Roth has been the minister of state for Europe at the German Federal Foreign Office in the third Merkel Cabinet since 2013. He is a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). 
Mr Roth, Hungary’s parliament is currently discussing a legislative package that could drastically curtail the rights of refugee organisations. Is Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán in the process of finally leaving the path of democracy?
Viktor Orbán is a head of government who of course was elected democratically. Nevertheless, I am deeply worried that his idea of a majority democracy means that he does not have enough regard for minorities and other views. The “Stop Soros” law package, with which Orbán wants to restrict the support of American billionaire George Soros towards Hungarian civil society and the work of refugee organisations, is disconcerting.



Western EU states tell Poland time running out to restore rule of law
Western EU states told Poland on Tuesday (27 February) that time was running out for it to address concerns in a dispute over democratic freedoms, mainly related to the rule of law and the judiciary reforms in the biggest eastern EU member country.


We have the impression, that Budapest’s state-subsidised anti-Soros-campaign is serving dangerous stereotypes: Soros is being demonised as a “Jewish financial capitalist” and an illegal refugee worker. Everyone is free to criticise Soros. But demonising him, as is currently the case in Hungary – I think this is immensely dangerous and unacceptable.
Is Orbán overdoing this in his aim to be re-elected in the parliamentary elections in April?
It is part of every election campaign to try and get a more favourable starting position. Nevertheless, a few principles must apply. It is unacceptable for an EU member state to be so derogatory towards our core European values as the Hungarian government sometimes is. Especially, because the EU is more than a single market. The EU is a community of shared values that binds all its members. The German government has no interest to break a bilateral conflict with Hungary, quite the contrary. But when somewhere in the EU core values of the community are disregarded, you cannot just ignore it.
Facing the breaches of European fundamental rights, should a procedure under Article 7 of the EU Treaty for the revocation of the right to vote in the Community also be initiated against Hungary, just as the Commission has already done in the case of Poland?
The Commission is already using various instruments in dealing with Hungary. These include a couple of infringement procedures. The Commission has our full support here. Whether one could also use Article 7 in this case, I cannot tell at the moment.



Poland critical of linking EU funds to rule of law
The European Commission’s proposal to link EU budget funds to the rule of law was seen as putting Brussels on a collision course with Poland. Jean-Claude Juncker recognised that there is a chance for rapprochement in the dispute with Warsaw. EURACTIV Poland reports.


In Brussels, infringement procedures against Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland have been initiated, because the three countries are refusing the EU decision to accept refugees. According to Orbán, migration is “dangerous for our security, for our way of life and for the Christian culture.”
Much would have been achieved if such propaganda were stopped in Budapest. There are currently approximately 400 refugees in Hungary. It is a distorted picture when it is claimed that a country is being overrun by refugees. Like Hungary, we believe that the protection of external borders has to be strengthened. It is not about building a “Fortress Europe”. Rather, all EU citizens have the right to know: Who is coming into the EU?
But if Orbán, despite everything, remains firm in his rejection of refugee quotas – should the responsible EU interior ministers once again have a majority vote for refugee quotas and overrule Hungary as they did in autumn 2015?
That has to be seen. One does really not have to apologize in the EU for using the usual legislative procedures. If we make use of these majority decisions, that is definitely no violation of the applicable law. In some countries, the question of integration and migration still is relatively new. There is less experience with it than in Germany. I understand that. That is why it is so important that countries like Germany serve as a good example and make it clear that while the diversity of religions, cultures and ethnicities can be exhausting sometimes, it also enriches us and makes us stronger.
Chancellor Angela Merkel has put forward the possibility to link the payment of EU subsidies for structurally weak regions with the admission of refugees. What do you think about that?
We should decouple the discussion over the EU budgetary period from 2021 onwards from the specific developments in Hungary and Poland. What we want to arrange for the future EU budgetary framework concerns all 27 EU member states. We support two considerations: First, it has financial implications if individual member states implement the structural reforms they demand or fail to implement.



Romania backs Poland in rejecting EU funding conditionality
Romania backed Poland yesterday (1 February) in vehemently rejecting proposals to tie future European Union subsidies to member states’ adherence to the rule of law.


Secondly, we also want to make the payments of EU funds generally dependent on the observance of rule of law principles. However, we should not only talk about sanctions and funding cuts. I propose to set up an own EU fund for fundamental values and the rule of law in the future. This fund could support civil society wherever the rule of law is under pressure. It would be conceivable to create such a pot of money under the existing European Fund for Strategic Investments. But we should not just talk about sanctions and budget cuts.
Speaking of Poland, what will happen next in the Article 7 procedure on the rule of law?
For a start, this is not about German-Polish dissent but about a necessary discussion between the European Union and Poland. I still hope that our Polish partners will be ready to comply with the provisions of the Commission. But on the other hand, it must also be clear that there will be no discount on issues concerning rule of law.
How do you see the role of Germany in the EU? Is Berlin a mediator between the “old” and the “new” member states?
We have to be self-critical about the fact that the “old” and “new” member states have remained very alien, even almost 14 years after the EU’s Eastern enlargement. It has not yet really grown together. We are far too little concerned with the situation in central and Eastern Europe. I am very impressed by the theses of the Bulgarian intellectual Ivan Krastev. He rightly tells the Western Europeans that we have not really been interested in central and Eastern Europe.
In the West, people often underestimate the tremendous economic and social transformation that has been going on in central and Eastern Europe since 1989. Since 2010, about 600,000 mostly young people have emigrated from Hungary alone. In particular, the mobile and European-minded people have left central European countries in their millions since 1989. This is a painful loss for our neighbours, which we must not forget.

                Less money won’t make Europe better, Kostas Hatzidakis, vice president of the main Greek opposition party, New Democracy (EPP), told EURACTIV Greece in an interview. He also stressed he would favour the cohesion policy to focus on Europe’s less developed areas and Financial Instruments to ensure less bureaucracy and more flexibility.
Hatzidakis said there is a window of opportunity until 2022 to build a more efficient Europe, including the cohesion policy. But he opposed any potential budget cuts after Brexit while acknowledging his ideas are “not popular with the rich countries of the EU”.
“No better Europe is possible with less money! Let’s deal with it. And let’s take advantage of the window of opportunity that exists until 2022 to build a more efficient Europe, including the area of cohesion. I understand that among the richer states these views are not at all popular. But ‘you cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs’.”
Hatzidakis, who is a former development minister, presented his view on the future of Cohesion Policy, favouring the second scenario of the three presented by the Commission, the one that foresees an emphasis on the less developed countries and regions.
Still, he was not sure if one of the three scenarios would ultimately prevail or if another proposal would be tabled.
Hatzidakis was also positive about the use of Financial Instruments since they ensure less bureaucracy, more flexibility and that the funds are directed to the real economy through the banks.
“No one can reject the new Financial Instruments, even more so when it comes to revolving funds. Since I have personal experience, the point is to have less bureaucracy in all these processes so that governments and regions are able to use both the resources that go directly to their funds and the resources that are disseminated in the real economy through the banks with flexibility.”
But for Greece, the financial instruments cannot solve the country’s problem as long as the problems of the banking system in the country are not resolved and the same applies to the EFSI funds.
“We are essentially talking about some major PPPs (public-private-partnerships) restoring confidence in the Greek economy and addressing the big issues of the country’s banking system. Without banks and investors, in our country, the Juncker Plan will remain problematic”.
On the next programming period, Hatzidakis said he had high expectations for the talks about Greece’s post-2020 envelope. Under the current programming period, Greece receives €20.5 billion in structural funds.
“I cannot even imagine limiting Greece’s support when it suffers severely because of a ten-year crisis”, he said.
Hatzidakis attacked the Greek government’s poor capacity to draw EU funds, stating that three out of four programmes of the ministry of development have not absorbed a single euro so far.
A fight that goes back quite some time with the ministry of development claiming to have succeeded a top performance among member states on the absorption of EU funds and New Democracy accusing the Government that no money reached the real economy and the beneficiaries.

                Next month, the EU’s alcohol industry will come up with a much-awaited self-regulatory proposal about labelling of alcoholic beverages.

This is what the industry says.

                European Commission Vice-President Jyrki Katainen said on Thursday (1 March) that Europe can compromise on many things, including Brexit, but not on the “more worrisome” threats to the rule of law and media freedom.
The Finnish commissioner, in charge of jobs, growth and investment, told an audience of businessmen to stand up for European values more forcefully.
“Values shouldn’t be only a nice thing to mention in anniversaries. I sincerely ask for your help to openly and vocally stand for EU values,” he said during an event celebrating the 60th anniversary of BusinessEurope. Euractiv was a media partner.
Katainen said that “at the end of the day, there will be a compromise with the UK” regarding its departure from the bloc. “But we cannot compromise on the rule of law”, he added.



EU Northern Ireland offer sparks Brexit war of words
An EU proposal to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit has prompted a war of words between London and Brussels, with UK Prime Minister Theresa May saying it would threaten the “constitutional integrity” of the UK.


Asked if he thought Poland represented a bigger threat to Europe than Brexit, the former Finnish prime minister said there were “some signals” about the erosion of the rule of law  in other countries than Poland but he did not elaborate.
He argued that the erosion of the rule of law is “more worrisome” than Brexit because of the risk that it becomes “mainstream and partially accepted” by politicians and society as a whole.

Commission vice-president Frans Timmermans voiced satisfaction that Poland has started a dialogue with Brussels. However, such a dialogue only makes sense when it brings results, he emphasised. Meanwhile, the Polish side is preparing a White Paper to defend its position. EURACTIV Poland reports.


He also expressed concern about press freedom and the protection of journalists.
His comment came a few days after the killing of a Slovak reporter who was investigating the ties of his government with the Italian mafia. Another Maltese investigative journalist was murdered four months earlier after she revealed numerous corruption cases affecting the political class on the island.
“I am more worried about the trend”, he said. “We cannot lose the EU setup, which is its fundamental values,” he added.



Murdered Slovak journalist 'was probing Italian mafia links'
Murdered Slovak journalist Ján Kuciak was about to publish an investigation alleging high-level political corruption linked to the Italian mafia, the news portal he worked for revealed today (28 February), as the killing stoked concerns about graft and press freedom in the small EU state.


BusinessEurope Director General Markus J. Beyrer highlighted during the same panel discussion the importance of upholding the rule of law for the business climate.
Some in the Polish business community voiced disappointment with the Commission’s  timid support for the private sector in the country. But they were hopeful that the situation will change this year.
The business community in Poland remains divided. Major firms in cities are more critical of their government’s actions, which have sparked tensions with the EU institutions. But smaller companies in towns show more affinity with the ultra-conservative executive in Warsaw.
Meanwhile, foreign companies don’t shy away from doing business with the current government in Poland, the same business representatives explained.



EU mulls new link between budget and rule of law
The EU’s justice commissioner is working on a proposal that could oblige member states such as Poland, which has clashed with Brussels over reforms to its courts, to pass tests on the independence of their judicial systems before receiving funding.


Katainen cited “preserving our fundamental values” as one of the challenges that the public and private sector should take up together. He added the defence of “open, fair and rules-based trade” and “embracing technological change while making our economy circular”.
Speaking in another panel Ann Mettler, the head of the European Political Strategy Centre (ESPC), highlighted the importance of values to attract businesses.
Against the backdrop of the “illiberal” trend and other political shocks across the planet, she said that Europe is “very attractive” not only because of its regulation.
“It is about values, democracy and freedom”, she said, referring to “what happens across the Atlantic but also across the channel”.
Background


Live: BusinessEurope Day 2018 in Brussels
In the context of its 60 anniversary, BusinessEurope discussed 'The value(s) of business' in a day-long event in Brussels on March 1, 2018. As Media Partner, we featured a live stream throughout the day that can still be watched. Keynote speeches included Donald Tusk, Jyrki Katainen and Michel Barnier on a key day in the Brexit negotiations.


            ","European Commission Vice-President Jyrki Katainen said on Thursday (1 March) that Europe can compromise on many things, including Brexit, but not on the “more worrisome” threats to the rule of law and media freedom. The Finnish commissioner, in charge of jobs, growth and investment, told an audience of businessmen to stand up for European values more forcefully. “Values shouldn’t be only a nice thing to mention in anniversaries. I sincerely ask for your help to openly and vocally stand for EU values,” he said during an event celebrating the 60th anniversary of BusinessEurope. Euractiv was a media partner. Katainen said that “at the end of the day, there will be a compromise with the UK” regarding its departure from the bloc. “But we cannot compromise on the rule of law”, he added. EU Northern Ireland offer sparks Brexit war of words An EU proposal to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit has prompted a war of words between London and Brussels, with UK Prime Minister Theresa May saying it would threaten the “constitutional integrity” of the UK. Asked if he thought Poland represented a bigger threat to Europe than Brexit, the former Finnish prime minister said there were “some signals” about the erosion of the rule of law in other countries than Poland but he did not elaborate. He argued that the erosion of the rule of law is “more worrisome” than Brexit because of the risk that it becomes “mainstream and partially accepted” by politicians and society as a whole.

                Armenian lawmakers today (2 March) will elect a largely ceremonial president to succeed Serzh Sargsyan as he seeks to extend his grip on power under a new parliamentary system of government.
The political shift comes after President Sargsyan in 2015 initiated controversial constitutional amendments to turn the impoverished Moscow-allied country into a parliamentary republic with a powerful prime minister.
Opponents of the 63-year-old leader — whose second and final term in office ends in April 2018 — say the reforms have been designed to increase his power, albeit in a new capacity as premier.
The sole candidate for the mostly ceremonial presidential post is an ambassador to the United Kingdom, Armen Sarkisian, who is no relation to the country’s leader.

Hand-picked by the president and nominated by the ruling Republican Party, the 64-year-old professor of physics, who briefly served as prime minister in the 1990s, is expected to easily garner the 79 votes needed for his election.
“Serzh Sargsyan wants to stay at the helm,” political analyst Stefan Safarian told AFP, suggesting that the leader’s ambition is to take on the prime ministerial post after stepping down as president on April 9.
‘Super prime minister’ 
“Everything is being done to hand over powers of the current president to a future prime minister. All of this is being done to create the office of a super prime minister,” opposition lawmaker Edmon Marukyan told reporters.
The new head of government — who will also serve as the nation’s commander-in-chief — will be nominated by the ruling party and appointed by the president.
Elected by the National Assembly for a single term of seven years instead of the current five, the president will be expected to largely rubber-stamp the prime-minister’s decisions.
According to recent amendments to the legislation, he will not be part of the country’s Security Council.
Pro-Moscow Serzh Sargsyan — who already served as premier in 2007-2008 — did not explicitly deny or confirm plans to become a prime minister again.
But in an interview with AFP last year, he vowed to “remain active” after leaving office and hinted that he would continue to influence Armenia’s politics as leader of the Republican Party.
The ruling party has defended the controversial reform as a move aimed at consolidating the ex-Soviet nation’s democracy and improving the balance between the legislative and executive branches of power.
“Democracy means distribution of powers, strengthening different political forces, parliamentary control over the government and that’s what the reform is about,” party spokesman and parliament vice-president Eduard Sharmazanov told AFP.
“The opposition will get more levers to influence political processes. We are moving towards a more democratic form of governance,” he added.
‘Nothing will change’ 
Many hold out little hope that the election will change their lives for the better.
“Nothing will change,” Iveta Mnatsakanyan, 65, told AFP.
She described the presidential candidate as a “very intelligent” person who lived in Britain for a long time.
“I am sure he is not fully aware of the country’s difficult moral, social and economic situation and just how corrupt the elites are. He will not be able to influence things for sure,” she added.
The constitutional amendments — which enter into force after Serzh Sargsyan steps down — were passed after a referendum in December 2015, with some 63% of the voters backing the changes.



Armenia holds referendum on divisive constitutional reforms 
Armenians voted in a referendum on constitutional reforms on Sunday (6 December) which the opposition claims are aimed at keeping the ex-Soviet state’s President, Serzh Sargsyan, in power.


But the opposition complained of widespread violations at polling stations, prompting thousands to rally in protest.



Armenian government stands firm against protestors
The Armenian government yesterday (25 June) refused to reverse a controversial electricity price hike, sparking fresh anger among thousands of demonstrators who have rallied in the capital for the seventh day in a row.


Council of Europe observers have said the referendum was marred by allegations of large-scale vote buying and multiple voting, among other irregularities.
A shrewd former military officer, Serzh Sargsyan has been in charge of the landlocked South Caucasus nation of 2.9 million since winning a vote in 2008.
After that poll, 10 people died in bloody clashes between police and supporters of the defeated opposition candidate. Serzh Sargsyan won a second term in 2013.

                EXCLUSIVE / French President Emmanuel Macron wants to “weaken” the European Parliament with his opposition to the Spitzenkandidaten process, European People’s Party influential MEP Elmar Brok warned in an interview with EURACTIV.com.
Brok, who is a close ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel, said Macron was pushing to have the transnational lists for EU-wide elections, which according to Brok undermines the legitimacy of the European Parliament, but at the same time opposes giving the people the “real power” through the Spitzenkandidaten process.
“With this behaviour, Macron wants to weaken the European Parliament,” Brok told EURACTIV.
Brok said the French President wants to take the election of the Commission President away from the Parliament and have it “behind closed doors” in the European Council again.
“Giving it back to the European Council is against the citizens, against European federalism,” the German MEP warned.
The Spitzenkandidaten process was first used in the 2014 election, when Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker was elected.
The Lisbon Treaty stipulates that the European Council, acting by a qualified majority, nominates a Commission president for the European Parliament’s approval while taking into account the results of the European Parliament election.
But, the EU Treaty does not make any reference to the Spitzenkandidaten procedure. In 2014, it was used following a “gentlemen’s agreement” among EU leaders. However, German Chancellor Angela Merkel had initially expressed concerns.
This time, ahead of the 2019 election, a number of member states, including Macron’s France, have opposed the process.
Macron’s progressive movement does not belong to any political family in the European Parliament and analysts explain that this is a reason he opposes the Spitzenkandidaten procedure, which favours the party with the largest majority.
On the other hand, the German right-wing parties control the EU Parliament, and through this process, can eventually influence the election of the future president of the EU executive.
Instead, Macron has been in favour of the ‘transnational lists’. In an effort to halt rising Euroscepticism and strengthen the sense of EU citizenship, Macron stressed that the 73 empty seats following the Brexit, should go to EU-wide constituencies.
The proposal was supported by the socialists and the liberals in the EU House but was ultimately rejected due to the EPP stance, which called it “irresponsible”.
Brok, who is also president of the Union of European Federalists, campaigned against the transnational lists, a long-standing request of the federalist movement. Some members of UEF reacted strongly asking for his resignation.
“Because I am a federalist, I am against the transnational lists,” Brok said, adding that this proposal is against any legitimisation of the EU Parliament.
“During my entire life, I have been a federalist, since I was 12 years old. I’ve always said that transnational lists are against federalism. In no federal state in the world, one can find transnational lists. Neither in the US nor in Germany and Switzerland.”
According to Brok, the members of the Parliament should be accountable to EU citizens and get their approval.
“I am in favour of an election system in which the citizens and the members of the European Parliament are as close as possible. Our main problem is that the Parliament is far away from citizens and with transnational lists, this gap will be widened,” he emphasised.
The MEP said that in order to have a real European debate in the EU election we needed to have a candidate for the presidency of the European Commission.
“We need to grant EU citizens the right to decide for the future of the European government.”



European Parliament votes against transnational lists
MEPs rejected the idea of a transnational list for the 2019 European elections on Wednesday (7 February), though they agreed to change the composition of the Parliament in light of Brexit. EURACTIV.fr reports.


Brexit getting difficult
Referring to the Brexit negotiation, he noted it becomes “more and more difficult”.
“Because we do not know yet the details, the will and the position of the British government. I hope now that the Commission has proposed a draft text of the Withdrawal Agreement, that they can sit down and negotiate on this, article by article.”
He said that a solution should be found until October including the conditions for the transition period, which is needed in order to “have enough time to come to a future agreement, a free trade deal or whatsoever, in the time afterward”.
Strong message to Skopje
Asked about Juncker’s recent statement that 2025 could be a possible date for some of the Western Balkan countries to join the EU, Brok said the executive had already pointed out that every country could hope for membership on its own merits.
He noted that 2025 could be a date but they may not reach it if they have not made the proper reforms in the internal market, fighting corruption, rule of law and democracy.
“I hope they will manage.”



Juncker tells Balkan states 2025 entry possible for all
European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker told Western Balkan countries on Sunday (25 February) to bear in mind 2025 as the date when any of them could join the European Union provided they worked to meet the criteria for membership.


On the long-standing name dispute between Skopje and Greece, he noted that this time there was a possibility of a solution.
“We are in a better situation than we were some years before, but it would be helpful for the Skopje government to understand that they have to tell Greece clearly that there is no irredentism.”
The Greek government has repeatedly asked the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) to amend the articles of its constitution of irredentism nature to ensure it has no claims on Greek territory.
But in an interview with the Financial Times on 28 February, Fyrom’s Prime Minister Zoran Zaev said Greece’s claims are “unreasonable”.
“Now the new requirement from Greece is that we need to change our constitution. But a constitution is a home rulebook. It doesn’t have implications outside the country. In any case, changing the constitution wouldn’t be a final guarantee, because a new government in the future could just change the constitution back again.”
Brok warned that the government in Skopje should make it clear that that none in the political community want to believe that parts of Greece should be part of Macedonia, which is the “root cause of the problem”.
Asked whether a change in the constitution is needed, he replied, “I think yes”.
“Would you agree to let a country join the EU if it wants to take over half of your country?” the German politician said.
“The EU is about that we accept the frontiers as they are, make these frontiers less problematic and open them more and more, but not change frontiers. That is one of the main reasons of European unification,” he concluded.

                Italy’s anti-establishment 5-Star movement and the far-right Northern League got enough votes to form a majority in yesterday’s election. Just imagine that repeated in next year’s European elections…
That would mean that more than half of MEPs would be from the far-right, separatist and anti-system forces. This isn’t just a nightmare scenario, this is probably the shape of things to come.
Since the last European Parliament elections, there have been over 31 parliamentary elections, 13 direct presidential elections and seven national referendums, including Brexit, across the EU.
As a result of those polls, the political landscape of the continent has been dramatically altered. Europe’s voters have sounded alarm bells that have been ignored.
Election results reveal extraordinary levels of voter discontent. Broadly speaking, the centre-left has massively lost support, while the far-right and different strains of nationalism went from strength to strength.
It is becoming more and more acceptable for centre-right governments to get in bed with the far- right. Just look at Bulgaria and Austria, the current and next holders of the EU rotating presidency. Nationalist ministers already chair EU ministerial meetings.
All of this has largely developed against the migrant crisis backdrop. In Italy, voters turned away from the mainstream parties as they felt abandoned by the rest of the EU, as its coastal areas bore the brunt of the influx of migrants crossing the Mediterranean.
Brexit is also happening because of migration-based fears, even if they were grossly amplified by a Eurosceptic tabloid press.
The election result in Italy is so bad that even a team-up between the centre-right of Berlusconi and the far-right Lega Nord and Brothers of Italy doesn’t seem like the worse option for Europe, given that the far-right and anti-establishment could also enter into coalition and get the nod to govern.
At least this weekend wasn’t all bad news. Habemus GroKo in Germany, where there promises to be a stable government. France is also looking pretty stable under Macron.
Top of the list for the French-German engine should be to craft some European remedies that can work across the EU27, ahead of the May 2019 European elections, including reassuring voters about immigration, security and social issues.
Otherwise these next European elections could very well be the last.

            ","Italy’s anti-establishment 5-Star movement and the far-right Northern League got enough votes to form a majority in yesterday’s election. Just imagine that repeated in next year’s European elections… That would mean that more than half of MEPs would be from the far-right, separatist and anti-system forces. This isn’t just a nightmare scenario, this is probably the shape of things to come. Since the last European Parliament elections, there have been over 31 parliamentary elections, 13 direct presidential elections and seven national referendums, including Brexit, across the EU. As a result of those polls, the political landscape of the continent has been dramatically altered. Europe’s voters have sounded alarm bells that have been ignored. Election results reveal extraordinary levels of voter discontent. Broadly speaking, the centre-left has massively lost support, while the far-right and different strains of nationalism went from strength to strength. It is becoming more and more acceptable for centre-right governments to get in bed with the far- right. Just look at Bulgaria and Austria, the current and next holders of the EU rotating presidency. Nationalist ministers already chair EU ministerial meetings. All of this has largely developed against the migrant crisis backdrop. In Italy, voters turned away from the mainstream parties as they felt abandoned by the rest of the EU, as its coastal areas bore the brunt of the influx of migrants crossing the Mediterranean. Brexit is also happening because of migration-based fears, even if they were grossly amplified by a Eurosceptic tabloid press. The election result in Italy is so bad that even a team-up between the centre-right of Berlusconi and the far-right Lega Nord and Brothers of Italy doesn’t seem like the worse option for Europe, given that the far-right and anti-establishment could also enter into coalition and get the nod to govern. At least this weekend wasn’t all bad news. Habemus GroKo in Germany, where there promises to be a stable government. France is also looking pretty stable under Macron. Top of the list for the French-German engine should be to craft some European remedies that can work across the EU27, ahead of the May 2019 European elections, including reassuring voters about immigration, security and social issues. Otherwise these next European elections could very well be the last. *** Did you know that EU towns and regions are active in sustainable development all over the world? The PLATFORMAwards ceremony is a unique opportunity to discover what they do to promote gender equality and local democracy, to support waste management and clean water… Three days left to register!*** The Roundup It took the Germans long enough so don’t expect a final deal on a new government any time soon in Italy. Matteo Renzi is speaking at 5pm, potentially to resign as PD leader. A mega pipeline between Russia and Northern Europe continues to court controversy.

                Foreign ministers from the Baltic states, three exposed allies on NATO’s eastern flank, visited Washington on Monday (5 March) to urge Western leaders not to respond naively to Russian threats.
The envoys from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania brought a stark message to meetings with top officials a city already gripped by political infighting and fears of Kremlin intrigue.
Sven Mikser of Estonia, Edgars Rinkevics of Latvia and Linas Linkevicius of Lithuania were careful to thank President Donald Trump’s administration for its support for NATO.

But, in an interview with AFP after their joint meeting with US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the ministers shared their concerns about Russia’a “hybrid” threat to the West.
“I think what we have seen in the past four or three years is the community of democratic nations is under the attack,” Rinkevics said of Russian interference and interventions.
“The very basis of our democratic institutions are under attack through social media by fake news, and also through the influence of money, and it is very important that we stick together.”

The Baltic republics will be able to reinforce this message once more on 3 April, when their presidents come to Washington for a White House summit with Trump they hope will send a message to Moscow.
Soviet collapse 
Rinkevics dubbed the threat “unprecedented since the 1930s and 40s” — the period during which the young Baltic republics fell under the control first of Nazi Germany then the Soviet Union.
Since the fall of the Soviets, the three have thrown their lot in with the West, turning away from Moscow’s orbit by joining NATO’s mutual defence pact and the European Union.
Russia’s current president, Vladimir Putin, has never made any secret that he resents this and regards former Soviet republics as belonging in Moscow’s zone of influence.
As recently as last week, when asked which single historical event he would most like to reverse, Putin replied: “The collapse of the Soviet Union.”


Putin says that he would like to reverse the collapse of the Soviet Union if he could. Highly reassuring to all countries that gained independence. https://t.co/5r7FsjJvwd

To many, such a statement might seem like electoral bravado designed to play on Russian nationalism three weeks before an election that is expected to confirm Putin in office until 2024.
But the Baltic states cannot afford to be complacent.
Already in 2018, Russia seized de facto control of a large chunk of Georgia. In 2014, Moscow annexed the Ukrainian region of Crimea and it still supports pro-Russian rebels in the east of the country.
The Kremlin might think twice about directly confronting a NATO member on the battlefield, but Russia — which has a struggling economy and stagnant population — has other methods of wielding influence.
The visiting foreign ministers know this only too well, their countries having long complained of “hybrid warfare” — military, financial and political manipulation backed by computer hacking and propaganda.
Putin continues to deny any involvement in the fighting in eastern Ukraine, for example, but US officials regard the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Lugansk as entirely Moscow-invented and controlled entities.

In Syria, Moscow’s intervention has been accompanied by the operations of a mysterious Russian mercenary outfit, and in the West, intelligence agencies have warned of repeated attempts to undermine electoral democracy.
In Washington, a special prosecutor has already brought several charges against alleged Russian hackers and online propagandists and is probing allegations that Trump’s campaign colluded with Russian agents.
The probe has angered Trump, who denies any collaboration and plays down the idea that Putin may have tried to swing the 2016 vote his way, as the White House staggers from one scandalous revelation to another.
Hybrid warfare 
Tillerson’s State Department has so far failed to draw up a list of targets for new sanctions on Russia despite Congress having passed a law authorizing tough new measures.
This week, it emerged that the department has yet to receive tens of millions of dollars that Congress wanted transferred from the defence budget to begin an anti-Russian counterpropaganda effort.
Trump has complained that the political focus on the scandal has undermined any effort he might have made to patch up ties with Putin and to work with Russia to fight terrorism and to isolate North Korea.
For the ministers, however, it would be a mistake to ignore one threat to deal with another, when cyberspace and the globalized economy and media marketplace are becoming one hybrid battlefield.
“Security these days is increasingly indivisible,” said Estonian envoy Mikser. “There’s no clear division between internal and external security, and also geographically. Security is becoming globalized.”
The visiting trio urged Washington to look the threat to their own and to European institutions in the face.
“We’re always suggesting to our colleagues in the United States and Europe to be more realistic, not to be naive. Dialogue is important as long as it doesn’t serve as a smokescreen to do nothing,” Linkevicius said.
The Lithuanian envoy noted Putin’s recent belligerent speech in which he boasted that Russia had developed a new generation of nuclear arms to bypass missile defences.

“That type of dialogue is not acceptable. And that’s military power, it’s not dialogue, it’s something else,” Linkevicius argued.
All three ministers agreed that they would like to see US troops based more permanently in the Baltics, alongside their British, Canadian and German allies.
“We really should act, and do this visibly with tangible means,” the Lithuanian said.
“NATO will never escalate. NATO will never be aggressive, but nobody should be in any doubt that we will do whatever necessary to protect our territories.”

                Greece has enormous potential and is getting ready to stand on its own feet when it exits its EU bailout in August, Eurogroup leader Mario Centeno told EURACTIV.com’s media partner Athens-Macedonian News Agency (ANA) in an interview.
The Portuguese finance minister explained that Greece is building a significant buffer to protect itself against turbulence in the financial markets.
Mario Centeno is the President of the Eurogroup. He spoke to ANA’s Christina Vasilaki. 
You have repeatedly stressed that the most important thing from now on is for Greece to have the ownership of reforms. Could you elaborate more on this?
Greece has entered its eighth year of adjustment. Such a long period of economic, social and political fatigue has left a mark on the economy. It was a very difficult process, in particular for the Greek people.
But Greece is a different country today. Structurally, there were critical improvements vis-a-vis the future. Nearly every sector of the economy was reformed, modernised and made sustainable. The budget deficit was reduced from 15% in 2009 to a surplus now. These are landmark achievements that many countries could look up to.
But eight years was too long a process. A stronger ownership of the process of adjustment by Greece could have delivered much sooner some of the good results we see today. Ownership has played a key part in regaining the confidence of investors and European partners in the last couple of years. It also helps to explain the rebound in growth. I hope this trend of sound policies will remain because I want Greece to continue to prosper. I see enormous potential in Greece.
From your experience, which reforms should Greece continue implementing after the end of the program?
We are working with Greece towards a successful completion of the program. The debate about the day after hasn’t started yet. At this point, the only thing I can say is that it is critical to preserve the growth-enhancing structural changes implemented during the program. The post-program framework will be discussed later, alongside possible new debt relief measures. I look forward to seeing the holistic long-term growth strategy the Greek government is preparing. This is the way to go. Greece is taking the helm.”
Do you think that Greece will be able to stand on its own feet after August 2018? It seems that some voices would prefer a precautionary credit line for Greece. What is your position, judging from Portugal’s case too?
Greece is getting ready to stand on its own feet. It is now following the best practices of financial assistance programs in Europe. It is implementing the program it agreed to with no delays. It is building a significant buffer to protect itself against any unforeseen events in the financial markets for over a year. It is rebuilding its name in the credit market, issuing bonds again. We also welcome the sense of discipline and clarity in communicating with the markets that help to improve credibility.
But this is a gradual – not an automatic – process. Greece remains sensitive to domestic and external shocks. But Greece is doing the right thing, by ensuring to the maximum extent possible that it will maintain market access after the program. If the conditions are met for additional debt relief at the end of the program, the Eurogroup – as was unanimously agreed – stands ready to help with this process.
At the end of the program, we will look at Greece’s exit strategy carefully. Now it is still too early. Greece has always been a unique case in the euro area. One common thread to all successful programs is ownership. Portugal is indeed an example of this. After the program, it continued to implement key structural reforms, like in the banking sector which had not been properly covered during its program.



Greece wants clean break from lenders, preparing own post-bailout plan
Greece expects to make a clean break with official lenders when its international bailout expires in August and has no reason to seek a precautionary credit line, its finance minister has told Reuters.


You recently said “we are going through a transition between political and electoral cycles in Greece” and “the next government should keep the ownership of the process”. Could you clarify what you meant by this, as we’ve seen a lot of different interpretations?
The end of the program will represent a new political reality in Greece. Whatever the framework of surveillance we all agree upon, Greece will regain control of its policies. As with any other European country, such policies need to be consistent with the European framework. It will have more leeway and that will represent more options for parties and for the Greek people. It will be good for democracy.
I say this bearing in mind the Portuguese example. We were able to meet the people’s demands for more inclusive growth and social justice. But – critically – we did so while respecting our commitments and the European rules and agreements. I am not interested in anticipating the outcome of any elections. I am simply recommending Greece to continue its own reform agenda.



Moscovici: Greece needs no ‘precautionary credit line’ but own growth strategy
Greece will not need a precautionary credit or anything that looks like a forced programme after it exits the bailout, and any new surveillance should treat Greece “as a normal country”, EU’s Economic and Monetary Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said.


The technical talks on the debt relief measures are ongoing. Could you please tell us where we stand right now and if you think Greece will finally get the debt relief it needs?
The process of debt relief in Greece has run in parallel with financial assistance due to very favourable lending terms of these loans. Also, Greece has received several sets of official debt relief resulting in big savings for the Greek budget. The debt has also benefitted from a haircut of privately-held debt. This has made debt more sustainable which is also positive for all EU creditors. In the coming years, there will be no debt overhang, but in the medium to long-term, Greece will see important repayment needs. This is why we are looking at the debt issue again.
We decided in January to start the technical work on new debt relief measures, namely on the growth adjustment mechanism. The so-called French mechanism would allow Greece to reduce its debt repayments if the economy underperforms. All additional debt measures will be developed first at the technical level. They will only be adopted if two conditions are verified: the program has to be concluded successfully and debt relief must be necessary for the Greek debt to be considered sustainable. For that, we need a proper analysis, which will be done by the institutions. That moment has not come yet.

                As a Twitter sage asked yesterday, would you Buymayr or Selmayr at this point?
The controversial way in which Jean-Claude Juncker’s chief of staff was promoted Secretary General of the EU executive is an unfolding scandal with the potential to sink the entire Commission.
Jean Quatremer, the star journalist at Libération, who first smelled the burn, already has the scalp of Jacques Santer on his belt. The then EU Commission chief resigned, which means the entire commission resigned, over the fictitious jobs case involving French Commissioner Édith Cresson and her dentist.
Juncker said he had known that former Secretary General Alexander Italianer wished to resign on 1 March when he appointed him to the post in the summer of 2015. He said he had kept the secret until the day he announced it, in order to preserve his authority, but Selmayr obviously knew. Quatremer calls it a coup d’état: everything happens as if Juncker, increasingly tired, announces symbolically that he is giving the keys of the house to his favourite eurocrat.
It is now official that EU Commissioners who had to approve Selmayr’s promotion were caught by surprise in the same way as the journalists in the pressroom were minutes later. In fact, a diet of leaks meant that journalists were less surprised. The Commissioners are hardly Selmayr fans.
Our colleague Pekka Mykkanen from Helsingin Sanomat quoted Selmayr as saying in 2016 that Juncker regards some of the Commissioners as boring as “walking sleeping pills” – a reminder that people in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones. Meanwhile, former Commission Vice-President Kristalina Georgieva on one occasion described the atmosphere around Selmayr as “poisonous”. He later made sure she left the Commission after she failed to be elected UN Secretary General.
The little lies, including about how many candidates there were for the intermediate job of Deputy Secretary-General (“several”, “less than four”, “two”…), have prompted MEPs to seek answers to “ethical questions” or even an inquiry by the European Parliament.
Quatremer alleges that Selmayr is buying the Commissioners’ silence, including by improving the financial package and perks they will receive after the end of their term. The Commission has denied it but its credibility has been dented.
While the Greens are at the forefront of the uproar, calling for a postponement of budget discharge until the Commission answers ethical questions, the EPP is opposed (unsurprisingly, since Juncker and Selmayr are their own), the liberals are scratching their heads, and the socialists are divided. By the way, the latter don’t even have a boss now.
The Conference of the Presidents of the European Parliament could, in principle, take a decision tomorrow to put the Selmayr issue on the agenda for next week’s plenary session in Strasbourg, but without the liberals and the socialists this seems unlikely.
If anyone will get Juncker’s scalp, our bet is it will be a journalist and not an MEP. The Machiavellian world around Juncker still has many secrets untold. Despite being faced with a chorus of disapproval, Selmayr hasn’t resigned yet but his situation is becoming untenable, and his obstinacy risks becoming contempt for democracy.

The Roundup
British MPs warned that rolling over EU trade agreements with third countries after Brexit must be treated as “an urgent priority” as the UK wants to be treated as a de facto member during a planned 21 month transition period, remaining party to around 40 EU trade agreements.
Meanwhile, European Council boss Donald Tusk says that a post-Brexit free trade pact with l’Albion perfide will inevitably have ‘negative economic consequences’.
Members of Italy’s vanquished Democratic Party are eyeing a possible deal with the triumphant 5-Star Movement to avoid deadlock. With this Matteo Salvini could be Western Europe’s first far-right leader since 1945.
The end of political uncertainty in Berlin was received with relief by Germany’s EU partners, as Chancellor Angela Merkel finally will have a full mandate to for crucial political decisions on EU-level.
After 25 EU governments launched the PESCO agreement in December to fund, develop and deploy armed forces together, EU defence ministers held their first meeting in the ‘PESCO format’ yesterday.
Following Gianni Pittella’s resignation, socialist MEPs are looking for alternatives to German Udo Bullmann’s candidature for the presidency of the group in order to avoid ‘Germanisation’.
As part of Belgium’s new nuclear strategy, from now on iodine tablets, which counter effects of nuclear radiation, will be freely available in pharmacies as the countries ageing nuclear reactors stoke safety concerns.
The Parliament could ask Marine Le Pen’s political group Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF) to repay an amount of up to €427,000 for “unreasonable” and “non-compliant” expenses.
As 2017 saw a new record in the number of requests for intellectual property protection in Europe, a Chinese company for the first time in history came on top in terms of patent applications in 2017.
A recent report suggests that health authorities still maintain a degree of scepticism about data collection on recurrence of metastatic breast cancer. But it is highly needed to support further research into the specific needs of patients.
Despite previous opposition, Greece officially opened the way for re-approval of the world’s most commonly used weedkiller, Monsanto’s Roundup, which contains controversial chemical substance glyphosate.
Look out for…
Tomorrow’s International Women’s Day events. To prepare, watch Commissioner Věra Jourová, in charge of gender equality, slamming EU member states for not eliminating pay and pension gaps fast enough.

                Spain marked International Women’s Day yesterday (8 March) with an unprecedented strike in defence of their rights that saw hundreds of trains cancelled and massive protests held in Madrid and Barcelona.
Called by 10 unions to demand gender equality, particularly where salaries are concerned, the 24-hour strike dominated headlines with famous female presenters noticeably absent from radio or television shows.

“This should be a starting point to change things. We are far from real equality,” Maria Angels Pina, a teacher in her 60s, told AFP at an evening march in Barcelona attended by around 200,000 people according to municipal police.
In Madrid tens of thousands of people, many wearing purple or holding up purple balloons — a colour long associated with gender equality — marched along the central Gran Via boulevard, chanting and holding signs that read “Justice!” and “Revolution”.

Smaller protests were held in dozens of cities across the country as women hung aprons on their balconies in a pre-arranged sign they were ditching domestic chores for the day.

Feminist groups also called on women not to spend money, particularly on items such as deodorant whose versions created for women often cost more.
Spain’s two main unions — the CCOO and UGT — were not part of the grouping that called the 24-hour strike but asked their members to stop work for just two hours on Thursday.
They estimated that 5.9 million men and women had observed the short stoppage.

‘Change the culture’ 
The strike was attempting to emulate Iceland’s 1975 work shutdown, when women took a day off in October to demonstrate their vital contribution to the country’s economy and society.
Pilar Lahoz, a 35-year-old office worker who carried a sign that read “Without us the world stops” at the protest in Madrid, said she has struggled to change jobs because potential employers rule her out when she says she is planning on having children.
“While we have advanced a great deal there is still much to do,” she told AFP.

The strike comes as countries around the world mobilised for #InternationalWomensDay, a worldwide trending topic on Twitter, and comes hot on the heels of #MeToo and #Timesup campaigns that went global with allegations of sexual misconduct in Hollywood.
Belen Ramiro, 40, who wore stickers that read “feminist strike” on her jacket at the march in Madrid, said she did not cook or do any other housework as part of the strike and her daughter did not go to school.
“We want to change the culture that it is women who are caretakers,” she told AFP.
Countless sarcastic memes circulated on social media and mobile messaging apps, with one video showing a man desperately trying to start a vacuum cleaner, pulling at the retractable plug cable like he would power up a lawnmower.

Spain fights hard 
Spain is a leading country in the fight for women’s rights and against gender violence, even though much remains to be done.
In 2004, for instance, the then Socialist government approved a law on violence against women that the European Council has upheld as an example to follow.
The groundbreaking legislation set up a hotline that would not appear on users’ phone bills, offered free legal aid and established special courts for victims.
Last year, though, 49 women died at the hands of their partners or ex-partners, an increase on 2016 when 44 were killed, official statistics show.
Women earn 14.9% less than men in Spain, slightly better than the EU average of 16.2 percent, according to the bloc’s statistics agency Eurostat.
It was not yet clear how many Spaniards went on the 24-hour strike, but trains on the Madrid and Barcelona undergrounds were less frequent than usual.
Meanwhile, more than 300 intercity and long-distance trains were cancelled throughout Spain.

Deputy PM speaks out 
High-profile women politicians and business leaders also spoke out strongly against inequalities.
Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria on Wednesday spoke of the discrimination she has suffered: “There are still many things that need changing because even as deputy prime minister you experience unacceptable sexist behaviour.”
Famous actresses such as Penelope Cruz and Rossy de Palma were also striking, with Cruz cancelling planned events and letting her partner Javier Bardem take care of their two children.

Ana Botin, the head of Santander, Spain’s largest bank, tweeted that “the motherhood penalty is not a myth”.

                Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki on Thursday (8 March) handed Brussels a detailed defence of Warsaw’s controversial judicial reforms and warned that any EU disciplinary action could deepen a “populist” backlash.
The EU in December launched unprecedented legal action against Warsaw’s rightwing government over “systemic threats” to the independence of the Polish judiciary, and gave it three months to comply.



Brussels triggers unprecedented action against Poland
European Commission Vice-President Frans Timmermans announced with a 04:13am tweet that the EU executive had activated Article 7 of the Lisbon Treaty against Poland, due to “a risk of serious breach of of the rule of law”.


With a deadline of March 20 looming, Morawiecki gave the Polish government’s 96-page “white paper” to European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker as part of a dialogue to end a two-year row.

“We expect a deep and serious analysis of this document,” Morawiecki told a press conference afterwards in Brussels.

Warsaw could be stripped of its voting rights in the 28-nation bloc under the Article 7 procedure of the EU treaty – covering systemic threats to the rule of law – which had never been previously used against an EU state.
An official summary of the Polish document said the EU had no justification for the Article 7 procedure because Polish judges “enjoy very strong guarantees” of independence, and because the reforms resemble regulations in other EU democracies.
The Polish paper warned sanctions could create a “dangerous precedent” for undermining the sovereignty of EU member states.
It could also lead to “a possible strengthening of anti-European sentiment that has been more and more apparent,” it added.
“It can further lead to growth of populist political forces seeking to dismantle one of the biggest successes in post-war Europe that is the European Union,” it said.
Poland’s ally Hungary, which has also clashed with Brussels over democracy issues, has vowed to veto any sanction.



EU rebels Poland, Hungary show united front
Poland and Hungary are winning the battle against the EU over immigration, the two countries’ premiers said Wednesday, with Hungary’s Viktor Orban predicting “a year of great confrontations” with Brussels.


‘Purge the rottenness’ 
Morawiecki – whose efforts to improve Poland’s image since his appointment in December have been marred by a row over a Holocaust law – blamed the reforms dispute in part on a communications failure on both sides.



Polish PM sacks key ministers, holds ‘friendly’ meeting with Juncker
Poland’s new right-wing Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki sacked his defence and foreign ministers in a major cabinet reshuffle yesterday (9 January), as he seeks to mend strained ties with the country’s EU partners.


“Two monologues don’t equal one dialogue,” the self-professed pro-European premier told the German Marshall Fund think tank later.
He added the reforms were aimed at rooting out judges from Poland’s communist era but the goal was hard to understand for Europeans who did not share the experience.
“Given this past we have to purge the rottenness out of this system,” Morawiecki said.
Calling his talks with Juncker “quite promising,” he said he hoped he would be able to convince the EU that the reforms guarantee judicial independence.
“I think we will be able to find a way out of this trap,” he added.
Juncker spokesman Margaritis Schinas said the Commission “will assess it (the white paper) carefully” while declining to comment on the atmospherics of the talks.
Schinas refused to comment on recent legislation passed by the Polish Sejm allowing the government to control a body overseeing judicial impartiality.



Polish conservatives take control of judicial watchdog
Poland’s conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party yesterday (6 March) moved closer towards controlling the country’s justice system by having its own candidates elected to a body overseeing judicial impartiality.


Poland began overhauling the judiciary after the rightwing Law and Justice Party (PiS) came to power in late 2015 in what observers called a populist wave.
The summary document argued that the reforms guaranteed as much independence as judicial procedures in Spain, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, France, and Britain.
On top of earlier court reforms, Poland’s rightwing-dominated parliament in December adopted reforms allowing it to choose members of a body designed to protect judicial independence and reinforce political control over the Supreme Court.
The EU has also frequently taken Poland to task for violating the bloc’s environmental standards and for failing to comply with a Brussels decision to relocate asylum seekers from Italy and Greece.



EU court fells Poland’s illegal logging of ancient forest
The European Court of Justice has confirmed that the logging of ancient woodland in Poland infringes EU law, paving the way for penalties against Warsaw and prolonging its spat with Brussels.

Calling his talks with Juncker “quite promising,” he said he hoped he would be able to convince the EU that the reforms guarantee judicial independence. “I think we will be able to find a way out of this trap,” he added. Juncker spokesman Margaritis Schinas said the Commission “will assess it (the white paper) carefully” while declining to comment on the atmospherics of the talks. Schinas refused to comment on recent legislation passed by the Polish Sejm allowing the government to control a body overseeing judicial impartiality. Polish conservatives take control of judicial watchdog Poland’s conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party yesterday (6 March) moved closer towards controlling the country’s justice system by having its own candidates elected to a body overseeing judicial impartiality. Poland began overhauling the judiciary after the rightwing Law and Justice Party (PiS) came to power in late 2015 in what observers called a populist wave. The summary document argued that the reforms guaranteed as much independence as judicial procedures in Spain, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, France, and Britain. On top of earlier court reforms, Poland’s rightwing-dominated parliament in December adopted reforms allowing it to choose members of a body designed to protect judicial independence and reinforce political control over the Supreme Court. The EU has also frequently taken Poland to task for violating the bloc’s environmental standards and for failing to comply with a Brussels decision to relocate asylum seekers from Italy and Greece.

Asked in an interview with the Kurier daily what future generations could learn from the Anschluss, van der Bellen replied: “Not to be taken in.”
People should not take “peaceful cohabitation, co-determination and stable political conditions for granted,” he warned. “These things can change.”
Van der Bellen — a former leader of the environmentalist Greens who in late 2016 beat an anti-immigration candidate in a polarising and nail-biting presidential election — said minorities enjoy better protection today.



Independent Van der Bellen defeats Austrian right
The Austrian Freedom Party’s (FPÖ) candidate in the presidential election, Norbert Hofer, has conceded defeat to his independent rival, Alexander van der Bellen.


“They can’t be outlawed at the stroke of a pen as they could then by a majority. If that weren’t the case, the state could be immediately turned into a tyranny of the majority, as happened back then.”
Van der Bellen has repeatedly called for vigilance and for tolerance since a coalition government took power in December, headed by the 31-year-old conservative Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, with the leader of the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ), Heinz-Christian Strache, as his deputy.



What lies behind Kurz’s defence of the far-right FPÖ
Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz intends for his government to be “measured by its actions”, just as Angela Merkel said it should be. Nevertheless, the young leader still has some explaining to do when it comes to his coalition partners. EURACTIV Germany reports.


The FPÖ, which counts former Nazis among its founders, is the oldest of the major right-wing nationalist and anti-immigration groupings currently on the rise in the European Union.
FPÖ politicians have repeatedly rejected neo-Nazism, racism and anti-Semitism since the party joined the ruling coalition.
The party has also expressed its gratitude to “the Republic of Austria, democracy, parliamentarism and the rule of law”.
But the FPÖ’s position regarding the status of the Austrian state has long been ambiguous, with a strong current within the party — particularly among student fraternities — viewing Austria as part of a wider pan-German or “Greater German” identity.
Appearing on Austrian television alongside other leading politicians for the Anschluss commemorations, Strache said it was everyone’s individual responsibility to remember “the National Socialist (Nazi) terror regime that murdered people on a large scale because of their religion, their origin and their political opinions.”
Embarrassing controversies 
But since it joined the ruling coalition, the FPÖ has found itself embroiled in a string of embarrassing controversies regarding its relationship to Austria’s history.
In January, for example, a leading FPÖ candidate in regional elections quit the party because of a scandal over song lyrics praising the Holocaust.
While Strache has been keen to clean up his party’s image, other incidents have tarnished it, such as one FPÖ member of parliament who declared in 2006 on television that “National Socialism also had its good sides”.
Many events marking the Anchluss anniversary feature eyewitnesses of the time, while public debates will focus on the responsibility of Austria and everyday Austrians in Hitler’s seizure of power.
Talking about such issues in public was almost unheard of until the late 1980s, as Austria preferred to hide behind the status of Nazi victim that the Allies had officially conferred on it.
Such denial has prevented Austria from embarking on the very painful “Vergangenheitsbewaeltigung” or self-examination and coming to terms with the past that Germany has undertaken.
Austrian conservatives began paving the way for Nazism as early as 1933 when they put an end to parliamentary democracy, then crushed the Social Democrats in 1934 and set up a one-party regime.
In a country in the throes of an identity crisis following the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian empire, and in full economic slump, anti-Semitism flourished as early as the 1920s.
“Everything had already long been ready by the time the Nazis arrived,” Kitty Suschny — who was just 13 in 1938 — told a conference, recalling that a ban on “dogs and Jews” was imposed overnight in the grounds of Vienna’s Schönbrunn Palace.
The persecution of Jews began in the early hours of the Anschluss.
And on 15 March, a euphoric crowd greeted Hitler in Vienna.

                Vladimir Putin’s popularity, 18 years after his accession to power, leaves no doubt about the outcome of the election in Russia taking place on 18 March. His popularity has been built on the systematic erosion of  his opponents’ credibility. EURACTIV.fr reports.
A second round of Russia’s presidential elections will surely not be needed. With popularity ratings that exceed 80% and 71.5%, Vladimir Putin will without a doubt be re-elected to serve a fourth term of six years during the first round on 18 March.
It is a carefully picked date, as it is the fourth anniversary of the annexation of Crimea. Seen as a territorial violation by the West, the 2014 annexation restored Putin’s image in the eyes of the Russians, at a time when the economy was floundering and opinion polls were going against him.
Putin mainly owes his popularity to a very efficient communication policy. “He presents himself as a very strong, athletic man, which corresponds to the idea that the Russian population has of a leader,” said Claude Blanchemaison, previously France’s ambassador in Russia and author of Living with Putin.
“Furthermore, with Ukraine and Syria he showed a certain military capacity,” he added.
Extreme control
He built his image as the right man for the job thanks to an extreme control over everything around him, starting with his opponents, as the presidential administration picks the presidential candidates.
Of the seven candidates given permission to run this year, none is likely to overshadow him. First behind Vladimir Putin is the candidate of the Communist Party, Pavel Grudinin, who is only polling at 7.3% according to a survey published by state-controlled survey centre VTsIOM.
The Levada Centre, one of the country’s biggest independent survey institutes is seen by the Kremlin as a “foreign agent” and has therefore no right to publish its opinion surveys during the presidential campaign, which lasts a month.
The president’s control over the media also allows him to discredit his opponents on TV, for example in a video aired by RT of a presidential debate, where nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky is seen insulting the only female candidate, Ksenia Sobchak, and calling her a “prostitute”.



MEPs bare teeth in debate over Russian propaganda
Moscow’s influence within EU member states worries MEPs. While the main political groups condemn the interference of the Kremlin, Eurosceptics have no qualms about defending Vladimir Putin. EURACTIV France reports.


The rise in number of candidates does not represent a risk for Putin, and gives a semblance of democracy. His only real threat, Alexei Navalny, was dismissed because of criminal convictions.
The 41-year-old lawyer is known for his extensive investigations on corruption in the government, which he publishes on his blog, and for the mass demonstrations he organised.
But behind this image of a long-awaited alternative to Putin, there is a controversial character who for many years organised  “Russian Marches”, which, although billed as anti-Putin demonstrations, were also nationalist events supported by racist and far-right groups.
“His programme is actually very populist. He promises nothing more than what Vladimir Putin does. […] He does not represent a viable alternative, he would only become another populist centrist president, defending the same positions as Putin. I don’t care if there are two candidates fighting for power representing the same values, what would be interesting would be defending different values,” said Ivan, a 30-year-old mathematician living in Moscow.
Vladimir Putin has not taken part in any debates, and only strives for one thing during this campaign: discrediting and “splitting his opponents left and right to keep them in a minority position”, said Blanchemaison.
Alexei Navalny has called for a boycott of the elections, urging the public not to vote.



Russia's Navalny detained as protesters point to poll fraud threat
Russian police wrestled opposition leader Alexei Navalny into a patrol wagon on Sunday (28 January) moments after he appeared at a rally to urge voters to boycott what he said would be a rigged presidential election in March.


The only risk: abstention 
Navalny’s abstention strategy has been criticised by some as it would give Putin an even greater numerical superiority but it is in fact what the Russian president dreads the most.
Whether they are for Putin or not, will voters still vote when there is nothing at stake in the election? “I am not going to vote because I believe that we don’t have a choice and I don’t want to legitimise this election. Besides it’s not an election,” said Elya a 27-year-old journalist in Saint-Petersburg.
These elections are mainly intended to legitimise his regime, so Putin has to ensure a high participation level and therefore wants to attract voters by any means.
According to an article published by Radio France International on the 1 March, in some regions selfie competitions will be organised at polling stations with prizes including iPhones, iPads and cars.
Youth in limbo
Faced with the country’s economic problems, Putin now knows that reforming the economy, making Russian industry more competitive and boosting investments, is urgent.
“Vladimir Putin is aware that the ‘Crimea effect’ can’t be repeated and that the legitimacy of the government and the survival of the regime depend on his capacity to satisfy the basic material needs of the population,” said the ECFR in its new report: The arrival of post-Putin Russia.
Young voters turning 18 this year have known only Putin. His economic achievements since coming to power in 2000 are therefore becoming increasingly obsolete with a large part of the population.
Russians put great stead in stability, and in their eyes Vladimir Putin is the one who re-established economic and social order. “Russian society went through extremely difficult times in the 1990s. People over 40 remember the situation all too well and have seen a considerable improvement under Putin,” Ivan explained.
”I don’t like Putin because I have lived in Sweden and Germany and I compare Russian to the countries of northern and western Europe. So I think that things could be better. Whereas my parents compare the current situation in Russia with Russia in 1993 when tanks were attacking the White House [Russia’s main government building] in Moscow, or in 1998 when the country went bankrupt. So for them things could be worse,” he added.
Claude Blanchemaison hopes that the EU will take advantage of this fourth term to assume its responsibilities and facilitate the flow of young people, researchers, and artists.
“It is not by imposing a blockade on Russia that we will facilitate change. One day there will be a successor to Putin, at which point there will be a need for a new generation of trained personnel,” he added.



On Putin's birthday, opposition activists protest, call for him to quit
Police detained more than 200 opposition activists on Saturday (7 October) for taking part in a wave of anti-Kremlin protests across Russia in support of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, ahead of a presidential election in March, a monitoring group reported.


BackgroundFormer head of the KGB, the Russian security agency, Vladimir Putin was appointed Prime Minister by Boris Yeltsin on the 9 August 1999. In his speech to the Russian Parliament, he promised to restore order, security and the territorial integrity of Russia.
One year later in 2000, he ran for the presidential elections and is elected with 52.9% of votes. He ran once again in 2004 which he also won with 71.5% of votes.
The Russian Constitution limited the number of presidential terms to two, Putin opts for a new strategy: in 2008 he appoints his Prime Minister, Dimitri Medevdev as president and becomes prime minister himself.
Under Dimitri Medevdev’s term, the Constitution is amended to extend the presidential term from four to six years.  This double act was to last another ten years as Putin is re-elected in 2012 with 63% of votes in the first round, despite major demonstrations against electoral fraud.
At present, Putin is pursuing his fourth term. If he is to be re-elected he will become president until 2024.

EURACTIV.fr reports.","https://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/opinion/tackling-fake-news-to-be-continued/","By Žiga Turk 12-03-2018","
                Fake news has been blamed for the election of Trump, the Brexit vote and the rise of populist parties in Europe. A High Level Expert Group (HLEG) on fake news has been set up by the European Commission to suggest how to address the problem. Žiga Turk, one of the members, shares his comments on their Final Report, released earlier today (March 12).
Žiga Turk is a professor of design communication and vice dean of the University of Ljubljana. He served twice as a minister in the government of Slovenia.
The Report is the result of the mission of the group – that fake news is supposed to be “tackled”. Hands off approach was out of the question.
The Report is also a result of the stakeholder/interest groups that were represented in the group – established media, journalists, fact checkers, selected civil society organisations, internet platforms and a few independents and academics, 40 in total. And it is the result of an extreme time pressure under which the group was working – it had four meetings in the span of less than two months.
The Report is a compromise. It includes some good and some bad ideas. And the Report excludes some good and some bad ideas.
Fortunately included
The Report reaffirms the commitment of the European Union to stand by the civil liberties. Like the freedom of expression as defined in the European Convention of Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
It states clearly that “all responses should avoid interference with freedom of expression and freedom to receive and impart information.” And that “initiatives aimed at countering specific problems of disinformation (…), need to be very precisely targeted and formulated to ensure that they do not by accident or design enable public or private authorities to restrict free speech.
“HLEG believes that EU or governments should” avoid the politically-dictated privatisation of the policing and censorship of what is and is not acceptable forms of expression”.
The Report recognises the Internet as the force of good for the prosperity of our countries and the vibrancy of our democracy. Yes, there may be some issues, but in general the impact is positive.
And the Report finds that in general our democracies have several strengths because of which they do not fall victim to disinformation. It is finding that content produced by quality, independent and pluralistic media is the best antidote to disinformation.
The suggested responses suggest diluting fake with real news, support quality journalism and pluralistic media environments in member states, investment in media literacy, in fact checking that a user can choose to shape his social media streams, for research of the size of disinformation problem as hard data on the disinformation problem is in fact scarce.
Unfortunately included
The Report suggests that a “Coalition” of all stakeholders to be established and proposes ten commandments that will guide it. This coalition will, assist the internet platforms in increasing the availability of “real” information and down-list the “disinformation”.
The Facebooks, Twitters and Googles of the world are supposed to demote “disinformation” and promote “real” news on their services.
After a year or so the Commission will check if these “voluntary” measures reduced the spread of “disinformation”. Voluntary is in quotes, because if the results are unsatisfactory, there is a threat of “fact-finding and/or additional policy initiatives, using any relevant instrument, including competition instruments or other mechanisms” against the platforms. In the worst case this can be interpreted as outsourcing of the policing of the internet to the platforms.
The proposed Coalition is risky. The threat of regulatory measures after a year of operation may motivate the platforms to interfere with the flow of ideas on their platforms in ways to please the governments. This could potentially lead to outsourcing of interference to “freedom to receive and impart information”. A balanced composition of the Coalition that includes independent content creators and free speech advocates should be able to mitigate this risk.
I am using quotes for disinformation as well because it us defined vaguely as “false, inaccurate, or misleading information designed, presented and promoted to intentionally cause public harm or for profit”. As if what does and what does not cause harm, what is and what is not misleading, was not flexible enough, the group chose to include in the definition things like “astroturfing, networks of fake followers, fabricated or manipulated videos, targeted advertising, organised trolling, visual memes and much more”.
The definition is broad and elastic. As free speech conventions do not make any differences between information and disinformation, the definition should be irrelevant.
Unfortunately excluded
The Report failed to address the growing fear that the platforms start pushing their own agendas when deciding how to present information. For example, favouring the information aligned with interests of the owners of the platform. Given the enormous power of some platforms, this strict reading of the Charter – which indeed only prohibits government interference – is a mistake. But understandable since the platforms should collaborate in the “Coalition” and actively shape what people see.
Fortunately excluded
The Report acknowledges that “government or EU regulation of disinformation can be a blunt and risky instrument” and makes no proposals to regulate speech now, because “legal approaches amounting to well-intentioned censorship are neither justified nor efficient for disinformation”. The EU remains a protector of human rights and hopes that the actors in the digital communication environment will be able to do something about disinformation autonomously.
The road ahead
“Or else”, should be added to the last sentence of the previous paragraph. Incentives may exists that the platforms will interfere with the flow of ideas on their platforms in ways to please the governments and avoid regulation in the future.
On the other hand, the Report shows deep respect for the freedom of expression. Commissioner Gabriel reiterated that: she stressed that nobody has a monopoly on truth and that truth is only established as a result of free confrontation of ideas.
The sensitive balance between freedom of expression and tacking the harmful effects of disinformation will require continued vigilance. As Ronald Reagan said, freedom is never far from extinction, it must to be fought for and protected.

            ","Fake news has been blamed for the election of Trump, the Brexit vote and the rise of populist parties in Europe. A High Level Expert Group (HLEG) on fake news has been set up by the European Commission to suggest how to address the problem. Žiga Turk, one of the members, shares his comments on their Final Report, released earlier today (March 12). Žiga Turk is a professor of design communication and vice dean of the University of Ljubljana. He served twice as a minister in the government of Slovenia. The Report is the result of the mission of the group – that fake news is supposed to be “tackled”. Hands off approach was out of the question. The Report is also a result of the stakeholder/interest groups that were represented in the group – established media, journalists, fact checkers, selected civil society organisations, internet platforms and a few independents and academics, 40 in total. And it is the result of an extreme time pressure under which the group was working – it had four meetings in the span of less than two months. The Report is a compromise. It includes some good and some bad ideas. And the Report excludes some good and some bad ideas. Fortunately included The Report reaffirms the commitment of the European Union to stand by the civil liberties. Like the freedom of expression as defined in the European Convention of Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. It states clearly that “all responses should avoid interference with freedom of expression and freedom to receive and impart information.” And that “initiatives aimed at countering specific problems of disinformation (…), need to be very precisely targeted and formulated to ensure that they do not by accident or design enable public or private authorities to restrict free speech. “HLEG believes that EU or governments should” avoid the politically-dictated privatisation of the policing and censorship of what is and is not acceptable forms of expression”. The Report recognises the Internet as the force of good for the prosperity of our countries and the vibrancy of our democracy. Yes, there may be some issues, but in general the impact is positive. And the Report finds that in general our democracies have several strengths because of which they do not fall victim to disinformation. It is finding that content produced by quality, independent and pluralistic media is the best antidote to disinformation. The suggested responses suggest diluting fake with real news, support quality journalism and pluralistic media environments in member states, investment in media literacy, in fact checking that a user can choose to shape his social media streams, for research of the size of disinformation problem as hard data on the disinformation problem is in fact scarce. Unfortunately included The Report suggests that a “Coalition” of all stakeholders to be established and proposes ten commandments that will guide it. This coalition will, assist the internet platforms in increasing the availability of “real” information and down-list the “disinformation”. The Facebooks, Twitters and Googles of the world are supposed to demote “disinformation” and promote “real” news on their services. After a year or so the Commission will check if these “voluntary” measures reduced the spread of “disinformation”. Voluntary is in quotes, because if the results are unsatisfactory, there is a threat of “fact-finding and/or additional policy initiatives, using any relevant instrument, including competition instruments or other mechanisms” against the platforms. In the worst case this can be interpreted as outsourcing of the policing of the internet to the platforms. The proposed Coalition is risky. The threat of regulatory measures after a year of operation may motivate the platforms to interfere with the flow of ideas on their platforms in ways to please the governments. This could potentially lead to outsourcing of interference to “freedom to receive and impart information”. A balanced composition of the Coalition that includes independent content creators and free speech advocates should be able to mitigate this risk.

                Here’s a sharp knife to cut through the tangled knot of Europe’s politics ‒ let’s hold all national parliamentary elections on the same day as voting for the European Parliament, writes Giles Merritt.
Giles Merritt is Founder and Chairman of Friends of Europe. This piece was originally posted on that organisation’s website.
Last week’s Italian election results look like being indigestible for weeks to come, perhaps months. Meanwhile, Europe can look forward to five more national polls ‒ Hungary, Latvia, Luxembourg, Slovenia and Sweden ‒ before the autumn.
Next year there are six ‒ Estonia, Finland, Belgium, Denmark, Greece and Poland ‒ as well as the mid-year European elections.
The disruptive effects of national elections on EU unity are generally seen as an unavoidable part of democracy in Europe; regrettable but inevitable. No one would dispute that, but do they have to be scattered across the political calendar? Is it so difficult to agree on the same five-year term for member states’ parliaments?
Flexibility could be built into any coordinated new system to accommodate political hiccups that would provoke fresh and unscheduled elections. There will be screams of protest against scrapping hallowed national parliamentary traditions, but the case for streamlining democracy in Europe is far more compelling.
Two clear problems threaten the whole project of European integration. The first is the seemingly inexorable rise of Eurosceptic populism, and the second is the series of deadlocks over how to make the EU more democratic. Rationalising national elections could provide the answer to both.
It’s conceivable that the Eurosceptic messages of the populists in different countries might combine into a pan-European rejection of the EU and its values. But it’s far more likely that the contradictory nature of these solidly national parties’ conflicting aims will be laid bare.
That would reveal overnight the inconsistencies of competing for national brands of Euroscepticism, while also forcing mainstream parties to state unambiguously their positions on EU solidarity issues.
The most immediate effect of holding all parliamentary elections at the same time is that before even a single vote is cast it will revolutionise media coverage. Press reporting would compare and contrast national debates, with the first beneficiaries being candidate MEPs seeking a European Parliament seat.
Declining public interest saw the EP’s 2014 voter turnout plummet to only 42% from 62% in 1979, a reflection of dwindling support for the EU itself. Creating a single European election day would certainly galvanise more excitement than the idea of a making a handful of EP seats ‘trans-national’.
The second effect would be to end the impasse over how the EU’s top jobs should be democratised. There will clearly be no change next year to the present highly unsatisfactory spitzenkandidat system, in which the next president of the European Commission will be the candidate of whichever EP grouping wins the most seats. But it’s also plain that there must be a meaningful EU-wide debate on a new method for 2024.
The present system is not genuinely democratic and is increasingly criticised for being yet another facet of the EU’s backstairs approach to decision-making. There is mounting support instead for the direct election of a ‘European president’ by all voters throughout the EU. The idea of merging the roles of the Commission and European Council presidents has been advocated by Jean-Claude Juncker and is said to be gaining ground.
EU member governments have been very wary of strengthening the Union’s powers, even by making it more democratically accountable. But their reluctance is tempered by their need to resist the Eurosceptics now challenging the mainstream political parties.
‘Old Guard’ voices in all 27 countries will decry the idea of streamlining national elections into same-day voting, but may well agree that we Europeans can’t go on as we are.

                Massive European Union funding to help Turkey’s stalled membership bid has “barely addressed” key problems with democracy and the media, the bloc’s spending watchdog said today (14 March).
Brussels has set aside more than nine billion euros since 2007 trying to prepare Turkey to meet the bloc’s standards in crucial areas of governance, the European Court of Auditors said.


#EU 🇪🇺 financial assistance for #Turkey, which aims to help align the country with #EUlaw, has had only a limited effect, according to a new report from the @EUauditors ▶️ https://t.co/RIqq7tFZzQ pic.twitter.com/tvigODheNk
— EU Court of Auditors (@EUauditors) March 14, 2018

But the watchdog slammed the European Commission for failing to attach conditions to the funds, especially after President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s crackdown in the wake of a failed coup in 2016.
“EU financial assistance for Turkey had only limited effect,” the report said. “The funds spent have barely addressed a number of fundamental needs.”
The watchdog said the results of the spending “may not be sustainable because of difficulties in spending the funds and backsliding on reforms.”
Turkish ambitions to join the EU date back over half a century but accession talks started in October 2005, after which Brussels started channelling so-called pre-accession funds to Ankara.
Brussels has allocated €4.5 billion for Ankara to prepare the country for membership in its current multi-year budget for 2014-2020. From 2007-2013 it allocated €4.6 billion.
European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker clashed with Erdoğan last year when he compared German leaders to Nazis.



Germany says Erdogan has 'gone too far' with Nazi jibe
Germany angrily warned Turkey yesterday (19 March) that President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan had gone too far after he accused Chancellor Angela Merkel of using “Nazi measures” in an escalating diplomatic feud.


Juncker also denounced the arrests of European media personnel in Turkey under a broader crackdown he said ruled out Turkey’s EU membership “for the foreseeable future.”
Report author Bettina Jakobsen said while the overall programme was “well designed”, funding had been particularly ineffective when it came to the independence of the judicial system, fighting corruption and media freedom.
These are “areas where critical reforms in Turkey are overdue,” she said, adding that EU funding should target them in future.
Jakobsen said the European Commission “rarely used the possibility of taking over” their management from Turkey when the money did not achieve the right results.
At the Turkish end, the ECA blamed delays on a lack of the right staff in key ministries and excessive turnover at the contracts unit which manages most EU funds.
She complained about “a lack of political will” by Turkish authorities under Erdoğan, who has faced growing criticism in the EU for his authoritarian style.
More than 140,000 people have been suspended or sacked in Turkey over alleged links to coup-plotters.



Germany says EU aid to Turkey could be halted over arrests
Germany raised the possibility on Wednesday (19 July) of suspending European Union aid payments to Turkey after summoning Ankara’s ambassador to Berlin to protest over the arrest of six human rights activists including a German citizen.


The ECA report will be sent to the European Parliament’s budget control committee, which will then likely grill the commission.

                With the slogan “Dare to change”, Belgian MEP Kathleen Van Brempt has submitted her candidacy to lead the group of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, a year before the EU elections. Her move surprised many who thought the only candidate would be German MEP Udo Bullmann.
Kathleen Van Brempt is a Belgian MEP and vice-chair of the S&D group. She is running to lead the group in the European Parliament after the departure of Gianni Pittella. The secret ballot is scheduled for the 20th of March.
Van Brempt spoke to EURACTIV’s editor-in-chief Daniela Vincenti.
Gianni Pittella, the S&D chair, has formally resigned after the Italian elections. You have decided to run for S&D group chair and challenge Udo Bullmann: what made you decide to take on this challenge?
I think a lot of people were surprised because Udo and I were quite a good team in the bureau and in the group, and I think we still will be after the election.
I’m not standing against anybody, I’m not standing against the German candidate. I stand because I am ready for it and that is very important for a top job, as you have to be ready for.
I have had a very diverse political life, the main red line in my political commitment is without a doubt Europe. I’ve been national minister, I’ve been regional minister, and I’ve also always been a local councilor in the city of Antwerp, so I like the diversity of pooling experience together so I feel ready to take on a very important European task, and I think one of the most important is leading this political group that I love so much.
I am a politician and I want to change politics, which is why my slogan is: “Dare to change”.
The S&D has been severely beaten in recent national elections – the last in Italy. It’s a huge challenge to reform social democracy across Europe. Reform is a word we have heard a lot about in the socialist family, but how to reform exactly?
Let me first just reframe what you’re saying because it’s not just social democracy that is facing difficult times in some of the Member States, it is the entire mainstream political establishment that is being challenged, and has been in crisis.
In France the centre-right party of Nicolas Sarkozy and Francois Fillon have been beaten as well. In Italy we didn’t do well as social-democrats but we did far better than Berlusconi.
It’s been pulled to the populist and extreme-right and extreme-left groups and that is a challenge for social democracy because we are and will always be a political movement that wants to change society and we want to change governments and be in governments, in order not to stay off the side and just talk about our ideas without actions, that’s not who we are.
So it is a challenge not only for social democracy, it’s a challenge of the centre, and to regain trust in politicians that are ready to stand, to take responsibility, to make compromises…
But how do you regain trust?
It’s not as we have been completely defeated in all the member states. Take Antonio Costa, prime minister of Portugal, who is in Parliament to discuss the future of Europe. He’s one of the leading social democratic figures, he changed politics and he changed Portugal. I witnessed that myself, when I visited the country three months ago. You feel the self-confidence of the people. Only a few years ago you still felt the despair.
Therefore, we need to be self-confident again, we need to regain this confidence. We can’t just say that we’ve been defeated and not do anything, the reality is much more nuanced and to win again you need to be liked, you need to build trust and you need to be confident. That’s what I want to give the group, as that is who I am, I’ve faced big victories and defeats in my political life, we all have, that’s what it’s all about. But if you stand proud of who you are that’s the starting point for change.
But how do you revive social democracy?
Well, first of all by going back to what we believe and create a new narrative, I did that together with Udo already, we are working on a new narrative for social democracy.
iI’s called “progressive society” and it’s about combining environmental climate issues with our social issues. One of the things I learned is that we are a big group: we unite different member states from the east, the west, the north and the south. That is a strength, but it means that we also need answers for these member states.
An example of that is to be able to prepare for the future. We need ambitious climate measures, like stepping out of coal in Europe. If I say that to my Romanian or Polish colleagues, they will think about the hundreds of thousands of people working in that industry in Europe. Social democracy can give the right answer by putting forward a proposal for a transition, not only on energy, but also on other sectors, working together with the people in all the member states.
That is one of the things that Hilary Clinton did so wrong. She went to the Belt States and talked about climate and its importance: yes of course because it is one of the major challenges along with inequality, and social democracy is the one that can give answers combining both of them. T
here is a liberal way to combat climate change but there is also a very social-democratic way, let’s start believing in that.
Still social democracy has deceived many. Is it time to do a mea culpa?
Oh yes! What we essentially did wrong is: after the financial crisis we social democrats have been part of many governments, which did not give the right answers. We saved the banks and then we went to member states and told them they had a budgetary problem, mainly in the South of Europe.
Then we created these budgetary rules, such as the two-pack the six-pack, which were very complicated. It was a huge mistake because at that time we made it seem like only budgets were important and we gave the message that we were ready to destroy for budgetary reasons parts of our social systems in some member states.
Social welfare is a basic value in Europe, not only a social democratic value. There is no other place in the world with the social welfare system we have. Every member state has a social security system. If you look at the US and look at the problems they have in trying to impose a healthcare system, in Europe it is natural, it is a basic value.
We as social democrats didn’t prevent Europe and the Commission from carrying out their actions on budgetary rules. We made mistakes. Don’t get me wrong we need good agreements on budgets and economic governance in Europe, but never at the expense of our social system, and so we made a huge mistake.
Do you think the “Macronisation” of politics is bad for Europe?
I don’t believe in the “Macronisation” of social democracy in any case. We need to reframe our values, but we need to stick to the original values. Macron is a pro-European so you have to work with him, but he is absolutely not a social democrat. So we should not contemplate a “macronisation” of our group, and regain trust in our values and our ideology.
I think that is what is crucial, going back to the source but reframe and rethink it in modern terms that’s is why we are talking about “progressive society”, that is why we loop the sustainability issues all together. Because a social democracy that is not tackling climate change in a way that everybody is proud and nobody is left behind, then it is not being dealt with in a proper way. Our values are still the same: making sure everybody is on board.
We’re heading towards the European elections, how do you think the group should prepare for that? 
We still have some important files to discuss such as the European budget, migration and asylum, and that is very crucial. The Italian elections outcome was also produced by the fact that we left the Italians on their own to deal with the migration problem, which should have been dealt with at European level.
The mobility package and issues on trade, we still have to define what we want to achieve on such files, but either we achieve them on the basis of progressive majorities in parliament, or we run the risk of making other mistakes.
As vice-president, I was responsible for the energy package. We achieved good results there so that every member of the socialist group can go home and say “on the energy files we achieved this, this and this”.
That needs to be done also, for instance on the Multiannual Financial Framework, the budget, if we cannot then we will call it a day. We should not make a blurry compromise with the EPP to get the MFF.
How do you build a winning electoral campaign so that you actually push more citizens to go and vote? 
Well, we certainly shouldn’t act as we have the last few weeks. The Selmayr case is very problematic I have to say, you cannot win a lot of votes by being trustworthy, transparent, and accountable but you lose a lot if you are not.
In that sense, I believe we need a much stronger European Parliament, we already started but we should be much firmer on such issues. People need to know that they can trust European institutions;
Juncker made a big mistake, we will wait for the budgetary control’s answers, but from an ethical point of view he made a huge mistake and he needs to deal with it.
Two weeks ago I went out to speak with students, and the first question they raised was “How can we trust you and Europe, if Juncker just appoints his chief of cabinet as secretary-general?” and you feel that it is a very important issue in building trust.
I’m not so afraid of the turnout in the sense that Europe has been high on the political agenda in almost every member state, not always in the best circumstances or with the best files, but at least we are debating and discussing Europe.
Although everybody says that people distrust Europe or that they are not interested in it, what I see is that at the end if you talk to people they want us to have solutions from a European point of view. On the asylum and migration issue, we can solve that problem, we’ve had very good proposals in the European Parliament let’s force the Council to come up with a solution..
Do you think it’s time for a woman to lead the S&D? All big political groups have been led by men in many years. Are Greens and GUE/NGL doing better on gender equality …?
There was Pauline Green 20 years ago … Well people often say “It’s time to have a woman,” you hear that a lot, and then they say “yes but do we have competent women?”. I invite everyone in the group to take a look at my CV to see what I have done in the Parliament, to see what I have done as a Minister and make their decision.
But let me stress that a chair can only make good music if she or he has a group and that is how I look at leadership. I think it’s time to change, we need a leadership that is open, that is communicative, but especially in our group we need a leader that is building bridges and that is the sort of leader I’ve always been as a Vice-president, as a Minister. I will never attack other people from other political groups, I will never attack on a personal level, I will never play the man or the woman, I will always value ideas and the basic values.
That’s the way to play a symphony rather than a cacophony?
Ooh that was a good one.



Kathleen Van Brempt, rebel with a cause

            ","With the slogan “Dare to change”, Belgian MEP Kathleen Van Brempt has submitted her candidacy to lead the group of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, a year before the EU elections. Her move surprised many who thought the only candidate would be German MEP Udo Bullmann. Kathleen Van Brempt is a Belgian MEP and vice-chair of the S&D group. She is running to lead the group in the European Parliament after the departure of Gianni Pittella. The secret ballot is scheduled for the 20th of March. Van Brempt spoke to EURACTIV’s editor-in-chief Daniela Vincenti. Gianni Pittella, the S&D chair, has formally resigned after the Italian elections. You have decided to run for S&D group chair and challenge Udo Bullmann: what made you decide to take on this challenge? I think a lot of people were surprised because Udo and I were quite a good team in the bureau and in the group, and I think we still will be after the election. I’m not standing against anybody, I’m not standing against the German candidate. I stand because I am ready for it and that is very important for a top job, as you have to be ready for. I have had a very diverse political life, the main red line in my political commitment is without a doubt Europe. I’ve been national minister, I’ve been regional minister, and I’ve also always been a local councilor in the city of Antwerp, so I like the diversity of pooling experience together so I feel ready to take on a very important European task, and I think one of the most important is leading this political group that I love so much. I am a politician and I want to change politics, which is why my slogan is: “Dare to change”. The S&D has been severely beaten in recent national elections – the last in Italy. It’s a huge challenge to reform social democracy across Europe. Reform is a word we have heard a lot about in the socialist family, but how to reform exactly? Let me first just reframe what you’re saying because it’s not just social democracy that is facing difficult times in some of the Member States, it is the entire mainstream political establishment that is being challenged, and has been in crisis. In France the centre-right party of Nicolas Sarkozy and Francois Fillon have been beaten as well. In Italy we didn’t do well as social-democrats but we did far better than Berlusconi. It’s been pulled to the populist and extreme-right and extreme-left groups and that is a challenge for social democracy because we are and will always be a political movement that wants to change society and we want to change governments and be in governments, in order not to stay off the side and just talk about our ideas without actions, that’s not who we are. So it is a challenge not only for social democracy, it’s a challenge of the centre, and to regain trust in politicians that are ready to stand, to take responsibility, to make compromises… But how do you regain trust? It’s not as we have been completely defeated in all the member states. Take Antonio Costa, prime minister of Portugal, who is in Parliament to discuss the future of Europe. He’s one of the leading social democratic figures, he changed politics and he changed Portugal. I witnessed that myself, when I visited the country three months ago. You feel the self-confidence of the people. Only a few years ago you still felt the despair. Therefore, we need to be self-confident again, we need to regain this confidence. We can’t just say that we’ve been defeated and not do anything, the reality is much more nuanced and to win again you need to be liked, you need to build trust and you need to be confident. That’s what I want to give the group, as that is who I am, I’ve faced big victories and defeats in my political life, we all have, that’s what it’s all about. But if you stand proud of who you are that’s the starting point for change. But how do you revive social democracy? Well, first of all by going back to what we believe and create a new narrative, I did that together with Udo already, we are working on a new narrative for social democracy. iI’s called “progressive society” and it’s about combining environmental climate issues with our social issues. One of the things I learned is that we are a big group: we unite different member states from the east, the west, the north and the south. That is a strength, but it means that we also need answers for these member states. An example of that is to be able to prepare for the future. We need ambitious climate measures, like stepping out of coal in Europe. If I say that to my Romanian or Polish colleagues, they will think about the hundreds of thousands of people working in that industry in Europe. Social democracy can give the right answer by putting forward a proposal for a transition, not only on energy, but also on other sectors, working together with the people in all the member states. That is one of the things that Hilary Clinton did so wrong. She went to the Belt States and talked about climate and its importance: yes of course because it is one of the major challenges along with inequality, and social democracy is the one that can give answers combining both of them. T here is a liberal way to combat climate change but there is also a very social-democratic way, let’s start believing in that. Still social democracy has deceived many. Is it time to do a mea culpa? Oh yes! What we essentially did wrong is: after the financial crisis we social democrats have been part of many governments, which did not give the right answers. We saved the banks and then we went to member states and told them they had a budgetary problem, mainly in the South of Europe. Then we created these budgetary rules, such as the two-pack the six-pack, which were very complicated. It was a huge mistake because at that time we made it seem like only budgets were important and we gave the message that we were ready to destroy for budgetary reasons parts of our social systems in some member states. Social welfare is a basic value in Europe, not only a social democratic value. There is no other place in the world with the social welfare system we have. Every member state has a social security system. If you look at the US and look at the problems they have in trying to impose a healthcare system, in Europe it is natural, it is a basic value. We as social democrats didn’t prevent Europe and the Commission from carrying out their actions on budgetary rules. We made mistakes. Don’t get me wrong we need good agreements on budgets and economic governance in Europe, but never at the expense of our social system, and so we made a huge mistake. Do you think the “Macronisation” of politics is bad for Europe? I don’t believe in the “Macronisation” of social democracy in any case. We need to reframe our values, but we need to stick to the original values. Macron is a pro-European so you have to work with him, but he is absolutely not a social democrat. So we should not contemplate a “macronisation” of our group, and regain trust in our values and our ideology. I think that is what is crucial, going back to the source but reframe and rethink it in modern terms that’s is why we are talking about “progressive society”, that is why we loop the sustainability issues all together. Because a social democracy that is not tackling climate change in a way that everybody is proud and nobody is left behind, then it is not being dealt with in a proper way. Our values are still the same: making sure everybody is on board. We’re heading towards the European elections, how do you think the group should prepare for that? We still have some important files to discuss such as the European budget, migration and asylum, and that is very crucial. The Italian elections outcome was also produced by the fact that we left the Italians on their own to deal with the migration problem, which should have been dealt with at European level. The mobility package and issues on trade, we still have to define what we want to achieve on such files, but either we achieve them on the basis of progressive majorities in parliament, or we run the risk of making other mistakes. As vice-president, I was responsible for the energy package. We achieved good results there so that every member of the socialist group can go home and say “on the energy files we achieved this, this and this”. That needs to be done also, for instance on the Multiannual Financial Framework, the budget, if we cannot then we will call it a day. We should not make a blurry compromise with the EPP to get the MFF. How do you build a winning electoral campaign so that you actually push more citizens to go and vote? Well, we certainly shouldn’t act as we have the last few weeks. The Selmayr case is very problematic I have to say, you cannot win a lot of votes by being trustworthy, transparent, and accountable but you lose a lot if you are not. In that sense, I believe we need a much stronger European Parliament, we already started but we should be much firmer on such issues. People need to know that they can trust European institutions; Juncker made a big mistake, we will wait for the budgetary control’s answers, but from an ethical point of view he made a huge mistake and he needs to deal with it. Two weeks ago I went out to speak with students, and the first question they raised was “How can we trust you and Europe, if Juncker just appoints his chief of cabinet as secretary-general?” and you feel that it is a very important issue in building trust. I’m not so afraid of the turnout in the sense that Europe has been high on the political agenda in almost every member state, not always in the best circumstances or with the best files, but at least we are debating and discussing Europe. Although everybody says that people distrust Europe or that they are not interested in it, what I see is that at the end if you talk to people they want us to have solutions from a European point of view. On the asylum and migration issue, we can solve that problem, we’ve had very good proposals in the European Parliament let’s force the Council to come up with a solution.. Do you think it’s time for a woman to lead the S&D? All big political groups have been led by men in many years. Are Greens and GUE/NGL doing better on gender equality …? There was Pauline Green 20 years ago … Well people often say “It’s time to have a woman,” you hear that a lot, and then they say “yes but do we have competent women?”. I invite everyone in the group to take a look at my CV to see what I have done in the Parliament, to see what I have done as a Minister and make their decision. But let me stress that a chair can only make good music if she or he has a group and that is how I look at leadership. I think it’s time to change, we need a leadership that is open, that is communicative, but especially in our group we need a leader that is building bridges and that is the sort of leader I’ve always been as a Vice-president, as a Minister. I will never attack other people from other political groups, I will never attack on a personal level, I will never play the man or the woman, I will always value ideas and the basic values. That’s the way to play a symphony rather than a cacophony? Ooh that was a good one.

                Returning foreign fighters, along with home-grown radicals, are heightening concerns that further attacks could be afoot. Dr. Demir Murat Seyrek and Amanda Paul argue there is room to beef-up security measures without creating a “police state” and maintaining respect for individual rights and liberties.
Dr. Demir Murat Seyrek is Senior Policy Advisor at the European Foundation for Democracy.  Amanda Paul is Senior Policy Analyst at the European Policy Centre (EPC).
March 22 marks the second anniversary of the Brussels attacks which left 32 people dead and injured more than 300. While the so-called “Islamic State” (ISIS) may have been losing ground in Syria, jihadist radicalisation remains a major threat for Belgium and Europe.
Returning foreign fighters, along with home-grown radicals, are heightening concerns that further attacks could be afoot. EU Counter Terrorism Coordinator, Gilles de Kerchove, estimates that there are more than 50,000 radical Islamists in Europe, including more than 2,000 in Belgium.
Without doubt, during the past two years important steps have been taken in Belgium and at EU level to tackle the problem. Threat awareness has increased across the board including amongst political parties, many of which had previously been in denial over the issue. New security measures, better intelligence sharing at different levels, and new cooperation mechanisms with third countries have also been implemented.
Still, there is room to further beef-up these measures without creating a “police state” and maintaining respect for individual rights and liberties. For example, reform of the Schengen Information System will help EU governments exchange information faster and better. Yet, while these measures are important in thwarting possible attacks, they will not avert radicalisation in the mid to long term. The latter needs to be tackled at its roots.
Preventing radicalisation is crucial to eliminating the threat of terrorism. Consequently, the term “prevention” has become a buzz word for governments, the EU, civil society and experts and it has led to an avalanche of initiatives. With significant funding available, especially at EU level, working on the topic has also become “a la mode” for many organisations. While there are effective prevention initiatives, there are also many with fancy names and big budgets which have had little or no impact.
While prevention is the right answer, the right tools are necessary to make a real difference. For example, more money should be injected into grassroots initiatives. While they are often small and not necessarily as professional as some bigger NGOs, their work is usually very effective. Supporting likeminded individuals and groups within Muslim communities as well as working with the role models is crucial as these people are credible messengers, who are taken seriously, particularly by young people.
Improving integration policies across Europe, many of which have to a large extent failed, is also crucial. Sharing good practices from different European countries is a starting point. New policies should empower the feeling of belonging to the country and Europe. Identity crisis makes people far more vulnerable to radical ideas and ideologies. We need to update the narratives about what it means to be Belgian, French, German, British, Italian in a way that is inclusive, making Muslim communities in Europe feel that they can be Muslim but European too. Different cultural and religious traditions should be embraced and not feared.
Education – especially what you teach – is pivotal in that regard. More emphasis must be given to concepts such as empathy, plurality, diversity, and dialogue. We should also not shy away from teaching European values, which are the basis of individual rights and liberties. Our politicians have been sacrificing many of these values. However, if Europe is to have a future as a free society, we need to go back to the factory settings and promote these values to create new generations of European, coming from different social, economic, cultural, and religious backgrounds but abiding by similar values.
A strong ideology is the cement of all radical ideas. This is the case for far-right and far-left and it is not different when it comes to the radical Islamist groups. There is a need to better understand and recognise the role played by ideology, which uses and abuses all above mentioned problems and others in order to justify violence. While ISIS is losing, the radical ideology behind ISIS is still very strong. We need to tackle this ideology to prevent jihadist radicalisation in Europe and beyond.
Cutting sources of funding for terrorism and terrorist networks is also vitally important. On 26 February 2018, a European Parliament report recommended a number of different measures that can be taken which the EU and its member states should take on board.  This includes stepping up the monitoring of suspicious organisations engaged in these kind of activities – illicit trade, smuggling, counterfeiting, and fraudulent practices via the formulation of joint investigation teams with Europol.

Eradicating radicalisation needs a joined-up approach that incorporates public bodies at both international, national, and local levels, social services, teachers, prisons workers, and local communities. Only by working together will we be able to exterminate this lethal phenomenon. It is a complex matter with no quick fix, especially after decades of obliviousness. The long run is not an attractive horizon for politicians who are often obsessed with the more immediate need to be re-elected. Nevertheless, we need a long-term vision with a clear strategy to prevent this threat.



EU anti-terror czar: ‘The threat is coming from inside Europe’
A year after the Brussels attacks, Gilles de Kerchove told EURACTIV.com about the fast pace of development of EU security policy, calling for the “systematic use of biometrics” and “batch comparison” of databases in order to boost security in the Schengen area.

                The European Parliament announced on Monday (19 March) that it will investigate allegations that millions of Facebook users’ data was misused without their knowledge. The European Commission also called for national watchdogs to open their own probes of the incident.
In a tweet on Monday (19 March), Parliament President Antonio Tajani called reports that the London-based data analytics company Cambridge Analytica harvested mass amounts of Facebook users’ data to swing the Brexit referendum and the 2016 presidential election in the United States “an unacceptable violation of our citizens’ privacy rights”.
Tajani said the Parliament will “investigate fully, calling digital platforms to account”.

Claude Moraes, the chair of the Parliament’s Civil Liberties Committee (LIBE), sent a letter to Facebook on Monday asking the platform to attend a hearing about the allegations on either  26 or 27 March, or 9 or 12 April.
“Such practices are worrisome and raise serious questions about the respect of the fundamental rights of privacy, data protection and freedom of expression of the affected users,” Moraes wrote in the letter. His office also sent the letter to the UK and Irish national data protection authorities.
The Observer and The New York Times reported on Saturday (17 March) that Cambridge Analytica may have illegally taken information from 50 million Facebook profiles and used it to influence the two political campaigns without informing the users.
The Leave campaign in the 2016 Brexit referendum and the Trump presidential campaign were both Cambridge Analytica clients, according to those reports.
The UK data protection authority is already investigating the incident.
On Monday, the British data protection chief Elizabeth Denham said, “A full understanding of the facts, data flows and data uses is imperative for my ongoing investigation. This includes any new information, statements or evidence that have come to light in recent days.”
Facebook’s European headquarters is in Ireland.
According to a whistleblower who worked at Cambridge Analytica, Facebook know about the company’s use of the data for two years but did not report it to users.
Tajani said in a statement, “This incident is more than a breach of data, it’s a breach of trust that can threaten the very functioning of democracy.”



Facebook tries out charm offensive with four EU Commissioners
Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg attempted to woo a team of four EU Commissioners during closed-door meetings Tuesday (23 January) on tense issues like hate speech and online platform transparency.


Facebook denied over the weekend that the incident amounted to a full-blown data breach—which would legally require the company to alert authorities about how private data was compromised.
The social media firm said over the weekend that it had suspended Cambridge Analytica’s account. In a statement on Saturday, the data analytics firm said that it complies with Facebook’s service terms and did not illegally harvest users’ profile data.
The European Commission also put pressure on Facebook to answer questions about its knowledge of the incident.
EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova will meet with Facebook representatives during a visit to Washington this week. Her trip was already planned to meet with US government officials including Secretary of Commerce WIlbur Ross and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, but Jourova’s office rushed to arrange the meeting with Facebook on Sunday after the allegations surfaced about the firm’s knowledge of the data harvesting.
She departed for Washington on Monday. In a tweet on Sunday, she described the incident as “horrifying, if confirmed”.


Horrifying, if confirmed. Personal data of 50 mln #Facebook users could be so easily mishandled & used for political purpose. We don't want this in the EU. #GDPR https://t.co/p2czcodOsi

“From a European Union perspective, the misuse for political purposes of personal data belonging to Facebook users – if confirmed – is not acceptable. In the EU, data protection is a fundamental right. As a rule, personal data cannot be used without the consent of the person concerned,” Commission spokesman Christian Wigand said.
Wigand said Jourova would raise the issue in meetings with US government officials.
In a rare move that highlighted the Commission’s concern, Jourova also asked the so-called article 29 working party, the umbrella group of national data protection authorities from EU countries, to open an investigation into the incident. The Commission does not have its own power to sanction companies that break EU data protection law.
The justice chief has already been in contact with the national authorities.
The data protection watchdogs can coordinate their national investigations into potential breaches of EU data protection law, and can fine companies separately if they are caught breaking the rules.
But in May, a stricter new EU data protection law will come into effect and give national authorities’ offices an arsenal of tougher powers. They will be able to launch EU-wide investigations into data protection violations and raise record-high fines of up to €20 million or 4% of a company’s global turnover.



National privacy watchdogs brace for new pan-EU powers

The UK is set to formally leave the EU on 29 March, 2019, after the British electorate narrowly voted in favour of parting ways in a referendum held in June 2016. The vote has split public opinion and generated much debate across the country, in Brussels and beyond.
“People did not know what they were voting for, it was voted for out of ignorance and fear,” Lucia Campetella, an Italian who has been in Britain for 10 years, told epa.
She said she felt “trapped” because despite deciding to leave the UK after the referendum and looking for work elsewhere in Europe, “London is the only city able to offer opportunities.”



EU, UK make major breakthrough in Brexit talks
The European Union and the United Kingdom have agreed a “large part” of what will make up the Brexit agreement, including the transition period, taking a major step towards ensuring the UK’s orderly withdrawal from the bloc next year, the two sides’ negotiators said on Monday (19 March).


For Dorota Staniak, a Polish citizen who owns a café in North West London, Brexit brought up questions of nationality for her family. “I ask my children and they first say they are British then Polish. They were born here and will come to think of themselves as British.”
She dispelled any idea that jobs for UK citizens were under threat by Poles: “Many people think Polish people take British jobs _ it’s not true,” she said, pointing out that when she worked as a cleaner in a hotel, only two out of the 40 employees were British.
“There are jobs and British people do not want to work in those sectors,” she said.
Nick Otterwell from Canterbury, a farm manager for a lettuce grower, was concerned about how Brexit would affect his industry in terms of staffing, pointing out that most of his company’s workers came from Bulgaria and Romania for a season.
“When Brexit happened, it affected the morale of the workers,” he said, adding that businesses would have to “work harder to attract staff” in the future, or else “crops won’t get picked.”
Gawain Towler, who has been a member of the United Kingdom Independence Party – a driving force behind Brexit – for the past 13 years meanwhile argued that the country would govern itself better alone than with the EU.
“Nobody thinks the world is going to be perfect after Brexit, but I don’t think there’s ever been a case in human history where greater freedom has been worse than less freedom,” he said, describing Remainers [those who wanted the UK to stay in the EU] as “fanatics and fanatical European nationalists” who “will stop at nothing.”
A property developer and co-founder of the “Leave Means Leave” campaign group warned that holding a second referendum on the issue would put democracy at risk.
“If there was a second referendum and Brexit stopped, then the belief in our democratic institutions would stop and we would be in totally uncharted territory,” Richard Tice said.
He suggested that people would “look back and say the UK is doing fantastic, what was all the fuss about?”



Lost trade will nullify Brexit dividend, UK government admits
A free trade agreement with the EU would still cost the UK 4.8% of its expected economic growth over the next 15 years, according to a confidential government ‘EU exit analysis’ published on Thursday (8 March).


Steve Bray, a pro-EU campaigner from Wales who stands outside the UK parliament every time it sits, suggested there was time to rethink the process and accused Brexiters _ those who wanted the UK to leave _ of deceiving voters.
“Those that were deceived into voting leave are from the more deprived areas and they are the ones who are going to pay the price,” he warned. “There is time to change your mind.”
Patrick Minford, a professor in Applied Economics at Cardiff University in Wales, described the EU as “protectionist” and “anti-competition,” an organization that protected EU producers but “not British.”
“It is an immoral system of theft, it steals resources from other countries and stops demand from other economies,” Minford said.
He argued that “unskilled” migration was putting a strain on the National Health Service because people were “not paying their way in the UK,” praising the system in Germany whereby citizens have to contribute before they can benefit.
“It’s not racism, it’s an economic argument,” he said.
Jane Pierce, a pro-EU campaigner from London who has lived and worked in France and Spain and would like her children to have similar experiences, was concerned that Members of Parliament did not appear to want to discuss the matter among themselves or with voters.
“After Brexit, Britain is going to look like an impoverished powerless beetle lying on its back,” she wagered.

"118","The surprising expansion of citizen dialogue","News","Future EU","20-03-2018","The European Parliament announced on Monday (19 March) that it will investigate allegations that millions of Facebook users’ data was misused without their knowledge. The European Commission also called for national watchdogs to open their own probes of the incident.","https://www.euractiv.com/section/future-eu/news/the-surprising-expansion-of-citizen-dialogue/","By Marion Candau | EURACTIV.fr | translated by Freya Kirk 20-03-2018","
                The European Commission has announced having already organised 500 citizens’ consultations since 2012, and says it plans to organise 500 more by May 2019. But the format of those dialogues is quite different from the citizens’ consultations put forward by French President Emmanuel Macron. EURACTIV.fr reports.
During a citizen debate organised in Paris on 15 March, around 40 young people posed questions to Mariya Gabriel, Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society, and Mounir Mahjoubi, French Secretary of State in charge of Digital Affairs.
The debate, broadcast live on Facebook Live, accounted for 4,600 views and hundreds of shares.
“Data protection, the fight against fake news, supporting innovation, the digital single market : there are many subjects to address,” the presentation of the debate on the Facebook page of the European Commission in France set the tone for the event, even though there were too many subjects for a debate that only lasted one hour.
Some participants found the format frustrating: “Next time, make sure the debate lasts more than an hour. Plan ahead, as each subject is interesting. It was more important to start on time rather than reduce the speaking time,” one internet user wrote on Facebook.
The Commission answered saying that it had done its best to organise the debate according to “the Commissioner’s and the minister’s busy agenda”. And a “top-down” approach, in which the Commissioner descends from her ivory tower to spend a few minutes talking to the masses, does not always go down well.
Nevertheless, the Commission is running on a tight schedule. It says it has organised 500 debates of this type since 2012, and aims to organise 500 more between now and the May 2019 European elections.
Key figure: 500
“Almost 500 of these interactive public debates have been held in 160 locations since 2012, and the Commission will increase their frequency between now and the European elections in May 2019, with the aim of reaching around 500 more events,” said a Commission statement from mid-February.
This figure seems to be the cornerstone of the Commission’s communication strategy.  “we have already organised 500 citizen debates,” said Mariya Gabriel before the end of the dialogue in Paris.
The Commission often sends out one of its 28 Commissioners to preach the good word about the benefits of the EU and respond to criticisms by European citizens that the elite is too far removed from its concerns. However, in practice, these debates are more in line with the Commission’s communication strategy rather than an in-depth discussion with citizens.



From phones to polls: How today’s youth can make the case for democracy
The European Parliament is exploring ways to convert the younger generation’s online engagement into higher turnout in the upcoming elections, write Ramón Luis Valcárcel and Sylvie Guillaume.


This is how Transport Commissioner Violeta Bulc visited Covilha University in Portugal on 4 March. On the same day, Vytenis Andriukaitis was in Sofia, Bulgaria, and two days before at the International Agricultural Show in Paris. While Günther Oettinger, Commissioner for budget, was in Malta on 1 March to talk of the multiannual financial framework.
The format is often as follows: a large number of citizens who turn up, a great many questions, but concise, and sometimes very hazy answers when the questions veer off into the politically incorrect. This is followed up by lots of photos, and then it’s time to get back on the train for Brussels.
The Commission believes these dialogues will motivate citizens to turn out and vote in the European elections, by including them in the debate on the future of Europe, but they fail to restore the image of an EU too often perceived as too framed and hierarchical.
French trust in EU
“It is necessary to generalise citizens’ consultations, and not just start the dialogue two months before the European elections. We must start in 2018,” said Mounir Mahjoubi, referring to the French version of citizen dialogues, an idea launched by Emmanuel Macron.
However, to achieve that, France is taking a different path than the Commission: starting the debate in civil society without involving the institutions.
Will the method change things? In the aftermath of the French President’s election, French trust in the EU greatly improved, going from 26% to 41% according to the autumn 2017 Eurobarometer, published on 15 March. However, six months later, only 33% of the French say they “tend to trust” the EU.

                The relations of the Visegrád Four with many EU countries, as well as with Brussels, are currently very tense. Despite some differences of opinion, Austria is endeavouring to establish a good neighbourhood policy. EURACTIV Germany reports from Vienna.
Austria’s accession to the Visegrád Group is not up for discussion and enlargement is being rejected by the four states themselves. However, the Viennese government should maintain and intensify cooperation, the director of the Diplomatic Academy, Emil Brix, told EURACTIV in an interview.
Brix imagines that Austria might also involve one or two other EU countries – such as the Netherlands and a neutral state – into a special cooperation. Ireland, for example, which will be particularly affected by Brexit, should be brought more into the centre of Europe.
Iron Curtain separated Europe into two worlds
In the coming year, it will be 30 years since the Iron Curtain fell, starting with Hungary on June 27, 1989, along the border with Austria. At the time, the Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock and his Hungarian counterpart Gyula Horn symbolically and publicly cut through the barbed wire fence at Sopron, which had divided Europe for 40 years and separated the two political systems from Grense Jakobselv in the north of Norway to Trieste on the Adriatic.
The political term “Iron Curtain” was first mentioned in 1920 by the Briton Ethel Snowdon in her travelogue on Bolshevist Russia. Today, it is mostly attributed to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who telegraphed to U.S. President Harry S. Truman on 12 May 1945, that “from Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the Continent.”



Visegrad's timid steps on Macron's EU citizens' project
Three of the member states of the Visegrad group are going to take part in Macron’s citizens’ consultations project. Hungary has yet to make its decision known. EURACTIV.fr reports.


In 1989, the Cold War era came to an end and Europe began to grow together again. The people’s democracies turned away from Communism and from Moscow, changed into new democracies and wanted to join the European Union (and NATO).
This was accompanied by a change on the European map whose geopolitical importance for the EU has not yet received the weight it deserves. Brix, along with Erhard Busek, former Austrian vice-Chancellor and foreign minister who is now the head of the Institute for the Danube Region and Central Europe, are together calling for this recognition.
Central Europe has shifted to the East and Southeast
The book “Central Europe revisited”, recently published by Busek and Brix, says: “Central Europe has shifted East and Southeast since the end of the ideological East-West division of Europe. It fills again the entire space between Germany and Russia. Central Europe is the future of Europe”.
Emphasising the importance of paying more attention to Central Europe, the book says “nobody knows where exactly the journey is going.”
This can be seen, among other things, in the questioning of traditional ideas of democracy (by Orbán in Hungary), tendencies towards stronger leaders (Vučić in Serbia, Kaczyński in Poland), and the general weakening of democratic institutions (in which parties mutate into movements).
And the Internet too would not lead to the “final triumph of direct democracy,” but with “Facebook & Co. rather create instruments of aggressiveness, that lead to polarisation.”
No “Mexit” in the centre of Europe
Central Europe expert Busek, who maintains many contacts in the region, sees no danger of a “Mexit” in the centre of Europe. Poland, as well as Hungary, is dependent on EU support.
None of the Visegrád states wants to leave the community, but the attacks against their respective neighbours (and Brussels) have increased, according to the findings. Moreover, “before and after the fall of the Iron Curtain there have been undoubtfully more initiatives for the establishment of neighbourly relations than there are today.”



Austria opts for dialogue with the Visegrád four
Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán is an irritation to many EU politicians. However, it is becoming clear that the new Austrian government relies on dialogue and wants to fulfil a “bridging function”. EURACTIV Germany reports from Vienna.


According to the authors, it is above all areas of science and culture, art and tourism, as well as infrastructure measures, that tolerate more intensive cooperation.
Engage against the divide of Europe
However, there is a lot of catching up to do when it comes to political rapprochement. In the public realm of the Central European states, the critique of the EU and of foreign influence is more and more on the rise. Whereby the critique is also often based on prejudices that are used by populist politicians to influence the electorate.
“It is important that the civil society of Central European countries strikes up the conversation about those topics,” reads the message of Busek and Brix. “The development of democracy in Central Europe will be more defining for the future of Europe than we have assumed until present. It has an impact on the functioning of the EU; on the future ideas of national identity and patriotism.”



Austria’s roadmap for its upcoming EU presidency
Brexit, the EU budget and security will be the three major priorities when Austria takes over the EU presidency in the second half of 2018, in what will be the final full presidency before all-important elections in May 2019. EURACTIV Germany reports from Vienna.


Austria takes on a special task here. On the one hand, because following the fall of the Iron Curtain, it has moved from the eastern edge of free Western Europe to the centre of the new Europe, and on the other, because of its traditionally and historically strong ties to this region.
“It is more important today than ever since the days of the Cold War to oppose the disappearance of the idea of Central Europe. Austria must stand up against this split in Europe. It is time for Austria to turn its attention more to Central Europe because only then can a truly common Europe emerge,” the book said.

But the format of those dialogues is quite different from the citizens' consultations put forward by French President Emmanuel Macron. EURACTIV.fr reports.","https://www.euractiv.com/section/data-protection/news/eu-heads-of-state-issue-warning-over-facebook-data-case/","By Catherine Stupp | EURACTIV.com 22-03-2018 (updated: 23-03-2018 )","
                The 28 EU heads of state issued a warning shot on Thursday (22 March) over allegations that 50 million Facebook users’ data was harvested without their consent to influence political campaigns.
“Social networks and digital platforms need to guarantee transparent practices and full protection of citizens’ privacy and personal data,” read conclusions from the leaders’ discussion at a European Council summit in Brussels.
They warned that “EU and national legislation must be respected and enforced” and vowed to discuss the “important issue” at their next meeting, which will take place on 17 May in Bulgaria.
The leaders’ statement did not refer to Facebook by name.
But European Council President Donald Tusk was more explicit. He told a news conference on Thursday evening that the leaders had “discussed recent developments concerning Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. It was clear to all the leaders that citizens’ privacy and personal data must be protected”.
The backlash from European heads of state comes after a tumultuous week for Facebook. Reports in the New York Times and the Observer last weekend alleged that the social media giant has known since 2016 but did not inform its users that their profile data was analysed for political campaigns by London-based firm Cambridge Analytica.
The data analytics firm reportedly worked for Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and the Leave campaign in the 2016 Brexit referendum.



Top EU privacy watchdog calls Facebook data allegations the ‘scandal of the century’
Privacy regulators from across the EU should join together to investigate allegations that London-based firm Cambridge Analytica illegally analysed millions of Facebook users’ data, the EU’s top data protection watchdog has said.


Vera Jourova, the EU justice Commissioner, told reporters earlier on Thursday that she will send a letter to Facebook on Friday to demand explanations about the incident. She did not elaborate about the specific questions she will ask the firm.
Jourova met with US Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross in Washington earlier this week.
She told reporters that the case involving Facebook and Cambridge Analytica does not only concern a potentially illegal breach of citizens’ personal data, but has “much more serious” implications, such as the threat to democracy and free elections.
“I’m sure this case will also be investigated from this angle and criminal justice as fraud, but it’s too early to say what the results will be,” Jourova said.
The UK data protection authority ICO is investigating the Facebook case as part of a broader inquiry into how personal data has been analysed for political campaign purposes. On Wednesday, the chair of the umbrella group of EU privacy regulators said that authorities from other member states are participating in a joint investigation led by the British watchdog.
The US Federal Trade Committee is also said to be probing the incident.
After days of public outcry, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg published a statement on Wednesday admitting that Cambridge Analytica’s use of the profile data was “a breach of trust between Facebook and the people who share their data with us and expect us to protect it”.
British MPs have summoned Zuckerberg to a hearing and the European Parliament has also invited him to speak before the chamber.
European Parliament President Antonio Tajani told reporters at Thursday’s EU summit, “We want to know if during the American elections and during the referendum on the Brexit, people used data for changing the position of the citizens.”



Facebook under pressure as EU lawmakers announce probes into data harvesting
The European Parliament announced on Monday (19 March) that it will investigate allegations that millions of Facebook users’ data was misused without their knowledge. The European Commission also called for national watchdogs to open their own probes of the incident.


            ","The 28 EU heads of state issued a warning shot on Thursday (22 March) over allegations that 50 million Facebook users’ data was harvested without their consent to influence political campaigns. “Social networks and digital platforms need to guarantee transparent practices and full protection of citizens’ privacy and personal data,” read conclusions from the leaders’ discussion at a European Council summit in Brussels. They warned that “EU and national legislation must be respected and enforced” and vowed to discuss the “important issue” at their next meeting, which will take place on 17 May in Bulgaria. The leaders’ statement did not refer to Facebook by name. But European Council President Donald Tusk was more explicit. He told a news conference on Thursday evening that the leaders had “discussed recent developments concerning Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. It was clear to all the leaders that citizens’ privacy and personal data must be protected”. The backlash from European heads of state comes after a tumultuous week for Facebook. Reports in the New York Times and the Observer last weekend alleged that the social media giant has known since 2016 but did not inform its users that their profile data was analysed for political campaigns by London-based firm Cambridge Analytica. The data analytics firm reportedly worked for Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and the Leave campaign in the 2016 Brexit referendum. Top EU privacy watchdog calls Facebook data allegations the ‘scandal of the century’ Privacy regulators from across the EU should join together to investigate allegations that London-based firm Cambridge Analytica illegally analysed millions of Facebook users’ data, the EU’s top data protection watchdog has said. Vera Jourova, the EU justice Commissioner, told reporters earlier on Thursday that she will send a letter to Facebook on Friday to demand explanations about the incident. She did not elaborate about the specific questions she will ask the firm. Jourova met with US Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross in Washington earlier this week. She told reporters that the case involving Facebook and Cambridge Analytica does not only concern a potentially illegal breach of citizens’ personal data, but has “much more serious” implications, such as the threat to democracy and free elections. “I’m sure this case will also be investigated from this angle and criminal justice as fraud, but it’s too early to say what the results will be,” Jourova said.

Despite some differences of opinion, Austria is endeavouring to establish a good neighbourhood policy. EURACTIV Germany reports from Vienna.","https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/opinion/how-to-save-the-transatlantic-alliance/","By Fraser Cameron | Cambre Associates 27-03-2018","
                To save the transatlantic alliance, it is essential for the EU to deal with its internal problems in order to become a more reliable and credible partner for the US in the future, writes Fraser Cameron.
Fraser Cameron is Director of the EU-Asia Centre and a Senior Advisor at Cambre Associates
For more than 70 years there has been strong bipartisan support in the US and Europe for the transatlantic alliance. EU-US trade in goods and services is about $1.1 trillion annually with mutual investment over $5 trillion. NATO is still in business.
But now these ties are weakening by the day as the Trump administration increasingly diverges from EU policies. According to the latest Pew Research polls, European trust in the US is at a historic low with less than 14% of the population in the two most important EU member states (Germany and France) having confidence in US leadership.
And the appointment of John Bolton, a convinced Euro-sceptic, as national security advisor does not suggest that Trump is keen to repair the damage. The EU must thus do more for its own security working from a stronger internal base.
What has Trump done to upset the Europeans? Leaving aside his intemperate language, coarse demeanour and attitude towards women, Trump has walked away from TTIP and the Paris climate change agreement, disparaged the UN, the EU, NATO and WTO, sought to kill the Iran nuclear agreement, embraced Putin, moved the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, started a new nuclear weapons programme, and threatened to bomb North Korea back into the stone age before agreeing a summit with Kim Jung-Un. 
He has now started a trade war affecting the EU and most of its main trade partners. The EU has managed to secure a six-week suspension of his planned 25% tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum. But then what? 
EU leaders seem in a state of shock and paralysis about Trump. At last week’s European Council they spent several hours discussing Russia but had no time for EU-US relations. Tusk, Juncker, and Merkel all have poor relations with Trump. Macron has a better personal relationship and has not been afraid to speak out on differences. May is handicapped by Brexit. Italy has no government. Others are silent.
So how should the EU act? In the past, when there was an American president they did not like such as George W Bush, the EU simply waited things out and hoped for an Obama figure. But Trump seems to reflect a more systemic change in US attitudes. Americans are no longer so keen to act as the world’s policeman and get involved in costly foreign wars. There is no evidence that the next US president, whether Democrat or Republican, would wish to reverse this retreat into quasi-isolationism. 
If the EU were simply to wait this time, perhaps for another seven years of Trump, the transatlantic alliance might simply wither away. John Bolton and many others in the White House view the EU as more of a threat than the closest ally of the US. The destruction or atrophying of the alliance, however, would only serve Putin who would feel emboldened to flex Russian muscles. 
This is why the EU must follow Merkel’s warning and take steps to look after its own security. From an American perspective, why should the US still shoulder the lion’s share of the security burden when the EU is as rich as the US and has more troops in uniform than the US? And is Russia such a serious threat when its GDP is only the same as that of Spain?
The EU should not seek an abrupt abrogation of American leadership. There are still many in the US who condemn Trump’s foreign and trade policies and one can only hope that the checks and balances built into the American constitution prove strong. But the EU will have to stand up and defend its support for the multilateral system as well as the specifics concerning Paris, Iran, the WTO, etc.
This will be easier if the EU operates with a strong internal base. Merkel and Macron are a solid duo but internal problems still prevent countries like Italy, Spain, and Poland playing a full role on the foreign policy stage. And EU leaders are facing fresh elections next year which will impact on their ability to make decisions. The institutions will need strong leaders.
The outcome of the EU’s fight against centrifugal nationalist and populist forces is not assured. These forces are a major threat to democracy and this is why it is so important for the EU to show that it is relevant to citizens’ lives, part of the solution and not the problem. 
The EU also has to explain better its comprehensive approach to security to the US and its own citizens. It is not just a question of spending more on defence (the American 2% obsession) but of tackling security problems with a comprehensive set of tools – military plus diplomatic, political, economic, technical, etc. You can easily bomb a regime into submission but it is much more difficult to ensure that a country has functioning institutions and a half-decent economy. Think Afghanistan and Iraq.
It is thus essential for the EU to deal with its internal problems in order to become a more self-confident security actor and thus a more reliable and credible partner for the US in the future. This is the only way to save the transatlantic alliance.

                This article is part of our special report Post-2020 CAP: simplification and investments.A revamped European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) with less paperwork and more long-term policy perspective focused on digitisation will attract more investment and more young people to the sector, EU farmers argue.
“Simplification is appealing to investors,” said Pekka Pesonen, the Secretary-General of Copa-Cogeca, the European organisation of European farmers and agri-cooperatives.
EU farmers say new generations will return to agricultural fields because they don’t rely only on direct payments. On the contrary, they want to take EU farming forward by involving other business activities, with stronger links to the more creative second rural development pillar.
“If you expect to have young farmers coming to the sector, none of them will do so because of the direct support alone,” Pesonent told EURACTIV.
“They are motivated to produce high-quality food, respond to the consumer needs, do it in a sustainable manner and, if the conditions permit, they also incorporate new elements like agritourism, water management, something that is not directly linked to the agricultural sector,” he added.
The European Commission and the member states are currently discussing the post-2020 CAP based on a communication, which suggests further simplification by granting EU countries “more room” to address their specific conditions.
Member are therefore expected come up with their own national plans to address their farming challenges.



CAP’s simplification should ensure EU internal market cohesion
Last year’s public debate about the European Commission’s drive to streamline the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) made clear that the EU’s flagship subsidy project is too bureaucratic and complex to be truly effective.


Pesonen explained that if there was one thing shared by most farmers across the EU, it’s that they are fed up with red tape.
The Commission has made a number of efforts in the past years to simplify the greening measures, which farmers had found too complicated although, as Pesonen said, “most of the farmers do not disagree with the objectives of greening”.
In a public consultation last year, farmers noted there was much more they could do when it comes to greening. But the way it was organised was too bureaucratic and farmers spent more time on “paper-pushing” efforts than on implementation of the measures on their farms, Pesonen said.
EU farmers say the member states should make “reasonable” and less bureaucratic strategic plans but at the same time stress that CAP’s commonality should be protected.
“The point is, while we give subsidiarity to the member states and we accept that, how can we ensure the commonality?  We need to come up with a set of EU-level principles about farming practices,” Pesonen emphasised.
A similar opinion is shared by IFOAM, the international organisation of organic farmers, who says flexibility and simplification should not come at the expense of a common EU framework.
“The CAP must remain a European policy that sets common objectives for the benefit of farmers, rural communities, consumers and the environment,” said IFOAM EU.
Referring to Brexit and its negative impact on the EU’s next long-term budget, Pesonen said cuts to farming funds were “absolutely out of the question”.
“If these savings are still on the table, we would not accept any kind of additional restrictive measures for farmers in terms of performance because this could be detrimental for the income.”
Digitisation and CAP
Luc Vernet, an expert from the think-tank Farm Europe, explained that in today’s volatile markets EU farmers needed more certainty.
“The future CAP needs to have a focus on resilience, risk management on the one side and crisis management on the other side. This needs a coherent toolbox in place at the EU level.”
Referring to the introduction of new technologies in the farming sector, Vernet stressed that in this transition period EU farmers should be given more time to adjust.
“Technologies in the farming sector are moving really fast. We have new plant breeding techniques in technology, we have data from precision farming. The CAP should not focus on the past but on the future. It should help farmers in this transition,” he said.
But in order for farmers to take the “digital leap”, they need to be granted the proper tools to face the risks.
“If we want them to go ahead, we need to help them and provide security for some years. This will secure their risk for some years and we need a transition scheme for precision agriculture as we have it for organic farming today,” Vernet said.
As for the investments, the EU should come up with a specific CAP investment targeting economic and environmental performance investments.
“It’s clear that in the future it will be much easier to have digitation approach and simplify all the procedures. This is why it’s not the right time today to reduce the common policy because more than ever before, we have the tool to make an EU policy simple – the digital tool,” Vernet said.
Define the objectives clearly
Geneviève Savigny, a campaigner with the European Coordination Via Campesina NGO (ECVC), told EURACTIV that more simplification at EU level could mean more complexity at the national and local level, considering the difficulties in implementing the current CAP.
ECVC is pushing for a CAP which is simple above all for farmers and calls for more market measures to ensure stable and remunerative prices, completed by direct payments in areas with natural or socioeconomic constraints.
Referring to the new delivery system and the national plans, Savigny explained that the pursued objectives should be clearly defined and accompanied by a timetable.
She said the Commission’s proposal to ‘foster a smart and resilient agriculture sector’ is very broad and conducive to different interpretations.
“The underlying model is clearly an agro-industrial model geared towards export and the constant competitiveness.”
“How can we be assured that such strategic plans can be designed in European countries where democracy is shrinking every day, or that it would be accepted by a Commission geared by trade and competition?” she asked.
She also pointed out that all relevant stakeholders, from the small and medium farmers, to consumers, NGOs and local authorities, should be involved in the definition of the strategic plan in a “fully inclusive process”.

                The Varna summit held on Monday (26 March) between EU institution leaders and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan failed to yield any notable outcomes. But Bulgaria’s PM said the port city could become a permanent venue for future talks.
The summit took the form of a working dinner with European Council President Donald Tusk and Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker and a litany of issues loomed large over their discussions.
Before the meet-up, Erdoğan embarked on a tour of Northern Turkey and delivered several speeches with clear anti-EU rhetoric. In particular, Turkey’s leader blamed the West for hosting what he calls terrorists.
Turkey and the EU differ on the definition on terrorism. Ankara calls terrorists all those perceived as enemies of Erdoğan’s regime, such as Kurds or followers of the preacher Fetullah Gülen, who is accused of being the mastermind by the failed June 2016 coup.



Erdogan comes to leaders meeting with footage exposing ‘EU terrorism support’
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan arrives in the Bulgarian port city of Varna today (26 March) equipped with video footage that allegedly illustrates Ankara’s claim that EU countries host terrorists and do nothing to fight them.


The state of emergency in Turkey continues since the coup attempt and mass purges are ongoing on perceived opponents. Independent media outlets have been closed and many journalists put in jail.
Turkey is also conducting military operations against Kurds in northern Syria that are raising eyebrows in Europe.
In Varna, some 120 journalists saw a different Erdoğan, who spoke a more appeasing language. “We hope that we have left a very difficult period behind in Turkey-EU relations,” said Erdoğan, who at the end of the press conference said “Let’s build together a prosperous Europe. I approach everyone with love and respect”, through an interpreter.

But he also stressed: “We don’t want rambling or unfair criticisms on sensitive issues like the fight against terror. We expect strong support.”
In term of concrete results, Tusk said the leaders’ meeting had made little tangible headway.
“In terms of concrete solutions, we did not reach a concrete compromise today but I still hope it will be possible in the future,” Tusk told the journalists.
Tusk said improved relations would depend on progress on issues including the rule of law and press freedom as well as Syria.
He also stressed that on migration and support for refugees, the EU and Turkey remain strong partners.
An EU-Turkey agreement brokered on 18 March 2016 promises Turkey, which is hosting 3.5 million Syrian refugees, €3 billion in aid, with a second €3 billion tranche in case the first one does not suffice. On 14 March the Commission approved the disbursement of the second tranche as well.
Tusk said he “sincerely thanks” Turkey and the Turkish people for hosting more than 3 million Syrian refugees. (Speaking later, Erdoğan said that Turkey is also hosting one million refugees from Iraq.)
He reminded that Turkey had committed to upholding the highest standards of democracy, adding that the EU understood Turkey’s need to deal effectively with security after the attempted coup, but that “we are concerned that some methods used undermine fundamental freedoms and the rule of law”.
Tusk expressed concern about Turkish actions in the eastern Mediterranean. Cyprus says that Turkey has breached “international law” after Ankara’s warships blocked operations to explore for gas in the island’s politically sensitive waters.



Cyprus, Turkey spar after warships block gas drilling ship
Cyprus yesterday (11 February) insisted Turkey had breached “international law” after Ankara’s warships blocked an Italian drilling ship on course to explore for gas in the island’s politically sensitive waters.


The Council president also raised the issue of the two Greek soldiers who inadvertently crossed the border due to bad weather and were arrested in Turkey.
He also said EU leaders had expressed concern over Turkey’s military actions in Syria, in particular in Afrin.
Juncker said the summit was one of “mixed feelings but not mixed messages”, adding: “It was a good meeting because as this is the normal principle between big democracies, we were able to talk in all frankness and openness.”

Regarding the Greek soldiers, Juncker said he had confidence in the Turkish side “to solve that in the best way”, and to free them before the Greek Orthodox Christmas (6 to 9 April).

Juncker stressed that the EU and Turkey should concentrate on what unites them, stressing the importance of the Southern Gas Corridor, a pipeline across Turkish territory designed to bring Azeri gas to Europe by 2020.
Juncker and Borissov praised Turkey for abiding by the migration deal. Borissov said that Bulgaria experienced “zero migration pressure” as a result of the deal.
Erdoğan thanked Borissov, whom he called his “great friend”, for hosting the meeting, and insisted that Turkey wants to progress faster toward its goal of becoming an EU member.
The Turkish president said he expected the second €3 billion tranche to be released soon, and called for visa liberalisation.



Turkey to press for visa-free travel at Varna summit
EU diplomats expect Turkey to press the issue of visa liberalisation during the upcoming summit in Varna on 26 March. It is still unclear if this is a real priority for Ankara or just negotiating tactics as part of a bigger picture.


Last month Turkey said it had fulfilled the 72 criteria for visa-free travel and Erdoğan told reporters that the necessary paperwork had been sent to the Commission.
The Turkish president said he told the EU leaders that it was “necessary to complete their work at once” on the issue.
Erdoğan also said Turkey was looking forward for the start of discussions on his country’s upgrade in the EU’s Customs Union.
Regarding terrorism, Erdoğan said his country’s operations contributed beyond its borders to the security of Europe and should not trigger any criticism.
He warned “certain members of the EU” not to be overly critical of his country and said he had tabled in written form information concerning the exploration of gas in the Cyprus economic zone.

In particular, Turkey’s leader blamed the West for hosting what he calls terrorists. Turkey and the EU differ on the definition on terrorism. Ankara calls terrorists all those perceived as enemies of Erdoğan’s regime, such as Kurds or followers of the preacher Fetullah Gülen, who is accused of being the mastermind by the failed June 2016 coup. Erdogan comes to leaders meeting with footage exposing ‘EU terrorism support’ Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan arrives in the Bulgarian port city of Varna today (26 March) equipped with video footage that allegedly illustrates Ankara’s claim that EU countries host terrorists and do nothing to fight them. The state of emergency in Turkey continues since the coup attempt and mass purges are ongoing on perceived opponents. Independent media outlets have been closed and many journalists put in jail. Turkey is also conducting military operations against Kurds in northern Syria that are raising eyebrows in Europe. In Varna, some 120 journalists saw a different Erdoğan, who spoke a more appeasing language. “We hope that we have left a very difficult period behind in Turkey-EU relations,” said Erdoğan, who at the end of the press conference said “Let’s build together a prosperous Europe. I approach everyone with love and respect”, through an interpreter. #VarnaSummit | ‘We hope that we have left a difficult period in Turkey-EU relations behind,' Turkish president says pic.twitter.com/Ihm9kx3Nry — ANADOLU AGENCY (ENG) (@anadoluagency) March 26, 2018 But he also stressed: “We don’t want rambling or unfair criticisms on sensitive issues like the fight against terror. We expect strong support.” In term of concrete results, Tusk said the leaders’ meeting had made little tangible headway. “In terms of concrete solutions, we did not reach a concrete compromise today but I still hope it will be possible in the future,” Tusk told the journalists. Tusk said improved relations would depend on progress on issues including the rule of law and press freedom as well as Syria. He also stressed that on migration and support for refugees, the EU and Turkey remain strong partners. An EU-Turkey agreement brokered on 18 March 2016 promises Turkey, which is hosting 3.5 million Syrian refugees, €3 billion in aid, with a second €3 billion tranche in case the first one does not suffice. On 14 March the Commission approved the disbursement of the second tranche as well. Tusk said he “sincerely thanks” Turkey and the Turkish people for hosting more than 3 million Syrian refugees. (Speaking later, Erdoğan said that Turkey is also hosting one million refugees from Iraq.) He reminded that Turkey had committed to upholding the highest standards of democracy, adding that the EU understood Turkey’s need to deal effectively with security after the attempted coup, but that “we are concerned that some methods used undermine fundamental freedoms and the rule of law”. Tusk expressed concern about Turkish actions in the eastern Mediterranean. Cyprus says that Turkey has breached “international law” after Ankara’s warships blocked operations to explore for gas in the island’s politically sensitive waters. Cyprus, Turkey spar after warships block gas drilling ship Cyprus yesterday (11 February) insisted Turkey had breached “international law” after Ankara’s warships blocked an Italian drilling ship on course to explore for gas in the island’s politically sensitive waters. The Council president also raised the issue of the two Greek soldiers who inadvertently crossed the border due to bad weather and were arrested in Turkey. He also said EU leaders had expressed concern over Turkey’s military actions in Syria, in particular in Afrin. Juncker said the summit was one of “mixed feelings but not mixed messages”, adding: “It was a good meeting because as this is the normal principle between big democracies, we were able to talk in all frankness and openness.” Remarks by @JunckerEU following EU-Turkey Leaders' meeting.#VarnaSummit pic.twitter.com/GvrvagvocQ — European Commission 🇪🇺 (@EU_Commission) March 26, 2018 Regarding the Greek soldiers, Juncker said he had confidence in the Turkish side “to solve that in the best way”, and to free them before the Greek Orthodox Christmas (6 to 9 April). .@JunckerEU #VarnaSummit: “#Turkey is a strategic partner.

Juncker and Borissov praised Turkey for abiding by the migration deal. Borissov said that Bulgaria experienced “zero migration pressure” as a result of the deal. Erdoğan thanked Borissov, whom he called his “great friend”, for hosting the meeting, and insisted that Turkey wants to progress faster toward its goal of becoming an EU member. The Turkish president said he expected the second €3 billion tranche to be released soon, and called for visa liberalisation. Turkey to press for visa-free travel at Varna summit EU diplomats expect Turkey to press the issue of visa liberalisation during the upcoming summit in Varna on 26 March. It is still unclear if this is a real priority for Ankara or just negotiating tactics as part of a bigger picture. Last month Turkey said it had fulfilled the 72 criteria for visa-free travel and Erdoğan told reporters that the necessary paperwork had been sent to the Commission. The Turkish president said he told the EU leaders that it was “necessary to complete their work at once” on the issue. Erdoğan also said Turkey was looking forward for the start of discussions on his country’s upgrade in the EU’s Customs Union. Regarding terrorism, Erdoğan said his country’s operations contributed beyond its borders to the security of Europe and should not trigger any criticism. He warned “certain members of the EU” not to be overly critical of his country and said he had tabled in written form information concerning the exploration of gas in the Cyprus economic zone. #EUTurkey #VarnaSummit pic.twitter.com/ZwbV1MiskL — Boyko Borissov (@BoykoBorissov) March 26, 2018",120

Instead of congratulating the President's coronation, they should instead make a renewed effort to voice their disagreement with his style of government, writes Anthony Dworkin.","https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/opinion/europe-and-the-egyptian-election-do-not-congratulate/","By Anthony Dworkin | European Council on Foreign Relations 27-03-2018","
                European leaders should treat the Egyptian election as the meaningless exercise it is. Instead of congratulating the President’s coronation, they should instead make a renewed effort to voice their disagreement with his style of government, writes Anthony Dworkin.
Anthony Dworkin is a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.
Voting in Egypt’s presidential election is still underway but the outcome is not in doubt. In the run-up to the poll, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has engaged in a carefully choreographed set of moves to prevent any serious candidate from running against him while preserving the illusion of a competitive race. Several credible candidates who attempted to run were blocked through arrest or intimidation, including two former senior military officials. At the last minute, an obscure politician who had earlier declared his support for Sisi was drafted in to provide some token opposition.
Sisi has led Egypt since he seized power in July 2013, and was elected as president in May 2014. Under his leadership, the country has been subjected to a regime of repression that is harsher than former President Hosni Mubarak’s regime prior to the 2011 uprising. Tens of thousands of people have been imprisoned for political offences, tight controls have been imposed on the press and civil society, and the security services routinely use torture and, increasingly, enforced disappearance. Sisi’s vision for the country allows no space for political opposition or expressions of public dissatisfaction, an approach that is clearly visible in the charade of these elections.
Since Sisi became president, European leaders have gradually come to accept him as someone they must do business with. This reflects Egypt’s perceived importance as a partner on issues such as terrorism and migration, its influence in the region (notably in Libya), and the commercial opportunities it offers. Many officials in the European Union are willing to admit in private that they believe Sisi’s policies do not offer a prospect of genuine stability and are likely to prove counter-productive in the long run. Nevertheless, Europeans tend to feel that outspoken criticism of Sisi would not have any positive effect and would jeopardise the EU’s relations with Egypt.
But cooperative relations with Egypt do not require the EU to adopt an uncritical stance. There is a difference between working with Sisi as a partner and endorsing him as a democratic leader – and these elections offer a significant opportunity for European leaders to make this distinction clear. Egypt engages with the EU because of its own interests and will not withhold its cooperation if European leaders adopt a degree of critical distance from the Egyptian regime. Moreover, the course of this election campaign suggests this may be a particularly important moment for European leaders to show that they do not buy into the picture that Egypt’s leader is at pains to present.
Most Egyptian analysts agree that Sisi’s hold on power is reasonably secure. He appears to retain a significant degree of public support, based on the idea that he stands between Egypt and chaos, and there have been few signs of large-scale opposition to him within Egypt’s elite. Nevertheless, some of Sisi’s recent actions have displayed signs of insecurity or, as some observers describe it, paranoia. In the last few months, Sisi removed both the army chief of staff Mahmoud Hegazy and the head of the General Intelligence Directorate, Khaled Fawzy. The reason for his actions remains unclear, but they provoked speculation that sections of the security services might be unhappy with Sisi’s leadership. The decisions of the former air force general Ahmed Shafiq and former military chief Sami Anan to run for the presidency also suggests that they may be aware of dissatisfaction among their former colleagues, even if Sisi was able to easily deflect their campaigns.
Shafiq and Anan are no one’s idea of liberals, but it is notable that in launching their campaigns both of them suggested that Sisi’s repression had gone too far. Anan had promised to appoint a former anti-corruption official as vice-president for human rights. Shafiq told supporters that “a true democracy and basic human rights are not a given”, though he put economic issues at the centre of his campaign. If these positions reflect broader concerns within the military and other parts of the elite about Sisi’s leadership, there could soon be a more decisive test of his support. There is widespread speculation that at some point after the election, Sisi may try to amend Egypt’s constitution to allow him to serve more than two terms, raising the prospect that he could retain power for many years.
Against this background, European leaders would undercut the position of any opposition to Sisi if they appear to accept him as the legitimate winner of a meaningful election. The eagerness with which Sisi has consistently sought endorsement by international partners suggests that it has some value within Egyptian politics. For this reason, the advice to EU leaders should be the same as that reportedly written in capital letters by Donald Trump’s advisers before his post-election phone call with Vladimir Putin (and ignored by the US president): Do not congratulate! European leaders should treat the Egyptian election as the meaningless exercise it is. And as Sisi embarks on his second term, they should make a renewed effort to find a way in their dealings with him to suggest that they disagree with his approach to the governance of Egypt, even while they work together on areas of mutual interest.

                The EU is still failing to address the issue of state capture in the Balkans and, by choosing stability over democracy in the region, has been undermining its own credibility and values. But now it must take strong actions in view of the 2025 admission perspective, writes Shpend Ahmeti.
Shpend Ahmeti is the mayor of Pristina, the capital of Kosovo. He was the leader of the New Spirit Party which merged in 2011 with the Movement for Self-Determination, where Ahmeti served as vice chairman before leaving the party in 2018. Ahmeti lectured on public policy at the American University in Kosovo and also worked for the World Bank for a number of years.
“Today, the Western Balkans countries show clear elements of state capture.” With this sentence from its new enlargement strategy adopted on 6 February 6, the European Commission eventually took the courage to put a name on the main problem facing our countries. But it also threw the cat among the pigeons as exceptional situations require exceptional solutions.
According to the World Bank, “state capture occurs when the ruling elite and/or powerful businessmen manipulate policy formation and influence the emerging rules of the game to their own advantage.” State capture is a form of grand corruption characterised by high levels of secrecy, which takes two forms: corporate state capture in which public power is exercised primarily for private gain and party state capture in which parties politicise the state in pursuit of political monopoly.
For years, progressive forces in the Balkans have been ringing the alarm bell that state capture is impeding progress on European integration and threatening the future of the region.
Kosovo and Serbia, in particular, have become showcase examples of captured political systems. Kosovo has long been a captured state in the hands of a ruling elite which has reigned over the country almost without interruption since the first government was established in 2002.
Since returning to government in 2012, Vučić has progressively dismantled any opposition and now exerts total control over Serbia’s centres of power, having effectively built an authoritarian regime. The developments of the last few days have demonstrated the depth of the problem.
On 21 March, the Kosovo Parliament passed a border demarcation deal with Montenegro, signed by President Thaçi in 2015 in his former role as foreign minister. The controversial agreement, which caused a huge division in society, was deemed by a special government committee appointed by PM Haradinaj to hand over 8,200 hectares of territory to Podgorica.
The vote passed with exactly the 80 votes needed, with tear gas in Parliament, and only thanks to an MP from the “Serbian List”, a party created by Vučić in the framework of the EU-facilitated Kosov-Serbia dialogue that is now monopolising Kosovo Serbs’ political representation.
The passing of the deal saved Thaçi from potential legal consequences while allowing Kosovo to meet one of the last EU conditions for a Schengen visa liberalisation.
In the days that followed, Thaçi and Vučić allegedly held a secret meeting in the US followed by an official one in Brussels to move on with another contentious EU conditionality, the creation of the Association of Serb Municipalities (ASM) in Kosovo, agreed upon in 2013 as part of the EU-facilitated dialogue.
Given that the ASM was deemed unconstitutional by Kosovo’s Constitutional Court because of its executive powers that would lead to the ‘Bosnisation’ of Kosovo, the tandem are looking for a way to establish it outside the Kosovo constitutional order.
On 26 March, Marko Djurić, the director of the Serbian government’s Kosovo office, was arrested in Northern Mitrovica in a spectacular police operation, brought to Pristina for a walk of shame, and immediately deported to Serbia. In a sign of protest, the Serbian List withdrew from the Kosovo government within 24 hours and announced it would unilaterally establish the ASM by 20 April.
Last Thursday (29 March) saw another unprecedented event observers have qualified as a suspension of the rule of law and of the constitutional order in Kosovo. Six Turkish residents identified by Ankara as supporters of Fethullah Gülen were arrested by the Kosovo Police and handed over to Turkish authorities, with the justification that they were a threat to national security.
All parties condemned the action and PM Haradinaj, who stated he had not been informed of the operation, immediately requested the resignation of the interior minister belonging to a junior coalition party and of the head of the Intelligence Agency, who is close to Thaçi.
The details of the operation and the reasons for the arrests are still unknown to the public. There were no court proceedings in the operation. While it is still unclear who gave the extradition order, Erdoğan’s statements over the weekend leave little room for doubt.
The Turkish president publicly thanked Thaçi for handing over the alleged Gülenists, while condemning Haradinaj’s moves and calling him a puppet politician who will be held to account.
The reasons that have pushed Thaçi to stage the above schemes are unclear, yet they may be linked to the issuance by the Hague based Special Court of its first indictments for wartime and post-war crimes by members of the Kosovo Liberation Army, potentially including himself.
Or something bigger is emerging, like the theme of exchange of territories between Kosovo and Serbia. Or both. The side effect is that Haradinaj is now heading a minority government following the departure of the Serbian List and risks further erosion of his numbers in case the interior minister’s party decides to leave the government.
Brussels’ favourite autocrats, Thaçi and Vučić, know too well the EU’s incapability to address such volatile situations and its tolerance of their authoritarian rule as long as political stability is guaranteed.
They have consistently used the strategy of the pyromaniac fireman to remain at the centre of the chessboard, particularly through the EU facilitated dialogue. In the near future, the tandem will likely try to hijack the new EU enlargement strategy and related initiatives on security, migration and reconciliation to impose themselves as key stability factors in the region.
Despite billions of euros spent, EU support to the Balkans has so far failed to address the systemic issues of state capture and match words with deeds, as is the case with the failure of the EU Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX) to try high-profile criminality cases which were eventually put back in the hands of captured local courts.
Worse still, the EU has been undermining its credibility and compromising with its values by choosing stability over democracy.
Addressing state capture and systemic threats to the rule of law, one of the main values upon which the Union is based, is clearly the most pressing issue in the Balkans.
Given that local safeguard mechanisms have been captured and are incapable to address those threats, the only remedies left are international pressure and building domestic consensus on ending state capture. For the EU, this means re-examining its approach and considering new ways to strengthen its capacity for societal change in the region.
The question remains, however, whether this is too heavy a lift for the EU which has accustomed us to pragmatic solutions based on short-term geostrategic interests rather than values and principles.
With the 2025 enlargement perspective offered to the Western Balkans, as well as illiberal democracy and Euroscepticism rising in several parts of the Union, the EU cannot afford to do business as usual.
It needs to live up to the challenge and take strong actions to end state capture in its future member states, including through its flagship initiative on the rule of law, which must become the cornerstone of enlargement policy and the upcoming initiative to strengthen the enforcement of the rule of law in the EU.
This means distancing itself from the captors and supporting democratising forces of the society beyond the executive, as key conditions to re-establishing checks and balances and ending state capture. The credibility of the Union and, more importantly, its very own future, are at stake.

The developments of the last few days have demonstrated the depth of the problem. On 21 March, the Kosovo Parliament passed a border demarcation deal with Montenegro, signed by President Thaçi in 2015 in his former role as foreign minister. The controversial agreement, which caused a huge division in society, was deemed by a special government committee appointed by PM Haradinaj to hand over 8,200 hectares of territory to Podgorica. The vote passed with exactly the 80 votes needed, with tear gas in Parliament, and only thanks to an MP from the “Serbian List”, a party created by Vučić in the framework of the EU-facilitated Kosov-Serbia dialogue that is now monopolising Kosovo Serbs’ political representation. The passing of the deal saved Thaçi from potential legal consequences while allowing Kosovo to meet one of the last EU conditions for a Schengen visa liberalisation. In the days that followed, Thaçi and Vučić allegedly held a secret meeting in the US followed by an official one in Brussels to move on with another contentious EU conditionality, the creation of the Association of Serb Municipalities (ASM) in Kosovo, agreed upon in 2013 as part of the EU-facilitated dialogue. Given that the ASM was deemed unconstitutional by Kosovo’s Constitutional Court because of its executive powers that would lead to the ‘Bosnisation’ of Kosovo, the tandem are looking for a way to establish it outside the Kosovo constitutional order. On 26 March, Marko Djurić, the director of the Serbian government’s Kosovo office, was arrested in Northern Mitrovica in a spectacular police operation, brought to Pristina for a walk of shame, and immediately deported to Serbia. In a sign of protest, the Serbian List withdrew from the Kosovo government within 24 hours and announced it would unilaterally establish the ASM by 20 April. Last Thursday (29 March) saw another unprecedented event observers have qualified as a suspension of the rule of law and of the constitutional order in Kosovo. Six Turkish residents identified by Ankara as supporters of Fethullah Gülen were arrested by the Kosovo Police and handed over to Turkish authorities, with the justification that they were a threat to national security. All parties condemned the action and PM Haradinaj, who stated he had not been informed of the operation, immediately requested the resignation of the interior minister belonging to a junior coalition party and of the head of the Intelligence Agency, who is close to Thaçi. The details of the operation and the reasons for the arrests are still unknown to the public. There were no court proceedings in the operation. While it is still unclear who gave the extradition order, Erdoğan’s statements over the weekend leave little room for doubt. The Turkish president publicly thanked Thaçi for handing over the alleged Gülenists, while condemning Haradinaj’s moves and calling him a puppet politician who will be held to account. The reasons that have pushed Thaçi to stage the above schemes are unclear, yet they may be linked to the issuance by the Hague based Special Court of its first indictments for wartime and post-war crimes by members of the Kosovo Liberation Army, potentially including himself. Or something bigger is emerging, like the theme of exchange of territories between Kosovo and Serbia. Or both. The side effect is that Haradinaj is now heading a minority government following the departure of the Serbian List and risks further erosion of his numbers in case the interior minister’s party decides to leave the government. Brussels’ favourite autocrats, Thaçi and Vučić, know too well the EU’s incapability to address such volatile situations and its tolerance of their authoritarian rule as long as political stability is guaranteed. They have consistently used the strategy of the pyromaniac fireman to remain at the centre of the chessboard, particularly through the EU facilitated dialogue. In the near future, the tandem will likely try to hijack the new EU enlargement strategy and related initiatives on security, migration and reconciliation to impose themselves as key stability factors in the region. Despite billions of euros spent, EU support to the Balkans has so far failed to address the systemic issues of state capture and match words with deeds, as is the case with the failure of the EU Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX) to try high-profile criminality cases which were eventually put back in the hands of captured local courts. Worse still, the EU has been undermining its credibility and compromising with its values by choosing stability over democracy. Addressing state capture and systemic threats to the rule of law, one of the main values upon which the Union is based, is clearly the most pressing issue in the Balkans. Given that local safeguard mechanisms have been captured and are incapable to address those threats, the only remedies left are international pressure and building domestic consensus on ending state capture. For the EU, this means re-examining its approach and considering new ways to strengthen its capacity for societal change in the region. The question remains, however, whether this is too heavy a lift for the EU which has accustomed us to pragmatic solutions based on short-term geostrategic interests rather than values and principles. With the 2025 enlargement perspective offered to the Western Balkans, as well as illiberal democracy and Euroscepticism rising in several parts of the Union, the EU cannot afford to do business as usual. It needs to live up to the challenge and take strong actions to end state capture in its future member states, including through its flagship initiative on the rule of law, which must become the cornerstone of enlargement policy and the upcoming initiative to strengthen the enforcement of the rule of law in the EU. This means distancing itself from the captors and supporting democratising forces of the society beyond the executive, as key conditions to re-establishing checks and balances and ending state capture. The credibility of the Union and, more importantly, its very own future, are at stake.",124

                With the recent revelations on the unlawful use of voters’ data to influence their political choices, both the EU and its member states need to take legislative measures to prevent such campaigning, which violated privacy rights and eroded democracy. The first step should be to end the lack of transparency, writes Nomi Byström.
Nomi Byström is a postdoctoral researcher in computer sciences at Aalto University, Finland.
Whistleblower Christopher Wylie’s revelations on the exploiting of voters’ data have been heavyweight not once but twice. In the European Union too, personal data of millions was harnessed to influence choices at the ballot box: to vote for leaving the European Union in the Brexit referendum of 23 June 2016. As for voters themselves, they were oblivious to what was done with their information.
But Wylie’s insights also affirm how truth can be stranger than fiction. Perhaps this is also the reason why, despite attempts to draw attention to the abuses of data for years, scholars, journalists and civil society organisations have had an uphill struggle to make their voices heard. The March revelations did not come out of the blue. Rather, they have brought much-needed attention to what has been known about shady and nothing short of unlawful campaigning activities.
Violating the UK Data Protection Act, enormous, politically significant databases were created and voters were targeted billions of times in the run-up to the referendum. It can only be hoped, to borrow Carole Cadwalladr of the Observer, that a public inquiry is held in England. In addition to the campaigns and companies, it should include an examination of the extensive foreign involvement.

Both the Union and member states need to take legislative measures against a repetition of campaigning that both violated privacy rights and eroded democracy, a fundamental value found in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union.
Expectations that the General Data Protection Regulation will single-handedly tackle harvesting of personal data to win at any cost at the ballot box are unrealistic. True, the GDPR does have sharp teeth with its administrative sanctions (up to 20,000,000 EUR or 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover), but a much-needed algorithmic bite is missing. And its Article 22 is limited to ‘a decision based solely on automated processing’.
Psychological manipulation of voters – with their own personal data – has become a threat to democracy. In addition to data protection, campaign financing and other rules may be ignored to intensify the personalised targeting.
First, the lack of transparency has to come to an end. The secretiveness of the entire scope of data processing; unavailable algorithms and closed proprietary platforms where the interference has been carried out have had damaging consequences. In addition to facilitating unlawful practices, they have hindered an open, constructive political debate and boosted extreme emotional material with little regard for the truthfulness of the content.
Transparency and effective oversight need to begin with, but not be limited to, Facebook. It should no longer be permitted to hide behind cosmetic improvements and polite apologies. Self-regulation has led to no regulation.
Campaigning and companies that disregard the law have to be made accountable. Fines alone are no deterrent. Rather, they favour wealthier candidates and their superrich backers. Political consulting, data analytics and digital advertising companies that engage in illegal hacking practices and intimidating, indoctrinating or threatening voters – anywhere in the world – should not be permitted to operate in the Union.
Last but not least, measures are required to tackle how foreign actors, typically beneath the radar, can become involved in national – or EU Parliament – elections in a variety of means, for example, building huge databases of voters, manipulating them from abroad, creating shell companies or with services and donations. Motives, in addition to undermining democratic institutions and destabilising society, include impacting how a country is run to advance own political goals.
Electoral campaigning has been massively disrupted, not least with data science. Yet the pertinent laws and powers of authorities may not even have caught up with digitalisation. To borrow the words of Vote Leave’s campaign director, ‘The law/regulatory agencies are such a joke the reality is that anybody who wanted to cheat the law could do it easily without people realising’.
And still, with the advances in machine learning, there is no longer even the need for the psychographics employed earlier by Cambridge Analytica. Voters can be subjected to relentless real-time surveillance, followed by ever-evolving, ever-more invasive and tailor-made manipulation.

                A German court yesterday (5 April) refused Spain’s request to extradite Catalan ex-leader Carles Puigdemont on a rebellion charge following his arrest in Germany last month, ordering his release on bail pending a hearing on a lesser charge.
In a heavy blow for Madrid, judges at the upper state court in Schleswig-Holstein “believe that in regard to the allegation of rebellion, extradition is illegal” as Puigdemont was not personally involved in violence during a referendum on Catalan independence last October.
That made his actions not punishable under German law, the judges said in a statement, rejecting prosecutors’ argument that the Spanish “rebellion” charge was similar enough to Germany’s “high treason” statute to justify an extradition.
The Catalan separatist figurehead could still be extradited on a charge of misusing public funds, the judges added, although “further facts must be clarified and information gathered” in the coming days and weeks.

In the meantime Puigdemont can leave custody if he fulfils court-imposed conditions including a payment of €75,000 euros.
Regional newspaper Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung reported that the politician would also have to report to the police every week and would not be allowed to leave Germany without prosecutors’ consent.
A spokesman at the Neumuenster prison where Puigdemont has been held since 25 March said he would not be released before Friday morning.
“See you tomorrow. Thank you very much to everybody!” read a tweet posted from Puigdemont’s account late Thursday.

‘Outrageous’ charge 
Puigdemont’s German defence team welcomed the court’s decision to set aside the “outrageous” charge of rebellion in a statement.
They “respected” judges’ decision to ask for more information from Spain on the misuse of funds charge in a “case with trend-setting signficance for the European understanding of democracy,” they added.
“[Puigdemont] always said that he had full confidence in the German judiciary,” his Barcelona-based lawyer Jaime Alonso-Cuevillas tweeted.

A Spanish government source told AFP that Madrid “always respects” judicial decisions “whether they please it or not”.
“The government is sure that Spain’s justice system will take the appropriate measures given these new circumstances, to ensure respect for the laws of our country,” the source added.
If extradited only on the charge of misusing public funds, Puigdemont cannot be prosecuted in Spain on the more serious charge of rebellion.
There is no such offence on German law books, although prosecutors had argued that it could be seen as roughly equivalent to the crime of “high treason”.
The misuse of public funds charge relates to the cost of the Catalan independence referendum, estimated at 1.6 million euros by Madrid.
News of Puigdemont’s bail “will reduce tension and pressure in Catalonia” where protestors have blocked streets and clashed with police in recent days, political scientist Oriol Bartomeus of the Autonomous University of Barcelona told AFP.
But the relief would only be “momentary”, he added, noting that “nothing has been resolved” by Thursday’s decision.
Puigdemont’s lawyers have appealed in Spain against the “rebellion” charge, highlighting that he was not involved in violence.
Public opinion in Spain is divided on whether the referendum constituted a “violent uprising” as described in the law.
Catalans mostly reject the rebellion charges, according to opinion polls, with a major demonstration calling for imprisoned separatist leaders to be freed planned for 15 April in Barcelona.
Flight across Europe 
After being removed from office by the central government in Madrid following a unilateral declaration of independence on 27 October, Puigdemont fled to Belgium.
He was arrested in northern Germany in late March on the way back from a trip to Finland.



Stormy protest in Barcelona after Germany arrests Puigdemont
Thousands of Catalan separatists hit the streets of Barcelona on Sunday (25 March), vowing the arrest of former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont in Germany would not stop their push for independence.


Puigdemont and six political allies escaped Spanish authorities in an attempt to “internationalise” their plight by dragging other European Union countries into the row.
A Belgian judge on Thursday bailed three of the four former Catalan ministers who fled to Belgium with Puigdemont after they handed themselves in to police there.
Spain wants the trio — Meritxell Serret, Antoni Comin, Lluis Puig — to face charges of rebellion, misuse of public funds and disobeying the state.
Nine other pro-independence figures are currently in custody in Spain, including six members of Puigdemont’s Catalan government and the former president of the Catalan parliament.

                Personal data from around 2.7 million Facebook users in the EU was shared with analytics firm Cambridge Analytica, the European Commission announced on Friday (6 April).
Facebook shared the new figure with EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova in a letter that she received Thursday evening, Commission spokesman Christian Wigand told reporters.
“Unfortunately some explanations fall short of my expectations. It’s clear that data of Europeans have been exposed to a huge risk and I am not sure if Facebook took all the necessary steps to implement change,” Jourova said in a statement on Friday afternoon.
The company was responding to an earlier letter that Jourova sent to the social media platform on 23 March, in which she demanded explanations about its knowledge of Cambridge Analytica’s alleged harvesting of up to 87 million Facebook users’ profiles for its work on political campaigns.
Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Chris Wylie alleged last month that Facebook users’ data was analysed without their knowledge—and that the UK-based company worked for Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and the Leave campaign in the 2016 Brexit referendum.



Whistleblower alleges illegal use of Facebook data swung Brexit vote
Cambridge Analytica illegally rigged the 2016 Brexit referendum by harvesting Facebook profiles, a whistleblower has told MPs.


Jourova will speak on the phone to Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg early next week.
Wigand said the letter did not include details confirming how many Facebook users in each EU country were affected by the data harvesting.
A Facebook spokeswoman said that Cambridge Analytica collected data from 1,079,031 in the UK and a total of 309,815 users in Germany.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg admitted during a conference call with reporters on Wednesday that the company had made mistakes in its handling of the incident. He said Cambridge Analytica’s collection of profile data through an app broke Facebook’s terms and conditions, which the analytics firm has denied.
Zuckerberg also said that Facebook will step up its privacy settings and apply the EU’s strict new data protection regulation, known as the GDPR, worldwide.
In response to backlash over the scandal, the company announced last month that it would shut down a feature that allows companies to collect Facebook users’ data in order to target them with advertising and other information. The company also changed its user terms to make its privacy policy easier to understand.
“I appreciate that they are trying to be more transparent,” Jourova said.
Her office is in contact with the United States Federal Trade Commission and the UK data protection authority ICO, which are both investigating the data harvesting.
Jourova called the incident “a threat to our democracy and electoral processes”.
ICO’s investigation of Cambridge Analytica and Facebook is part of a broader inquiry into whether political campaigns have broken privacy laws by analysing citizens’ personal data.



Facebook tries out charm offensive with four EU Commissioners
Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg attempted to woo a team of four EU Commissioners during closed-door meetings Tuesday (23 January) on tense issues like hate speech and online platform transparency.


“I would like to speak with Ms Sandberg about how they intend to ensure transparency and respect the rules of our democratic debate and how they plan to change once the GDPR is in place,” Jourova said.
The GDPR will give people in the EU more rights to privacy, and add hefty fines of up to €20 million, or as much as 4% of their annual worldwide turnover, for companies that break the law.
“This story is too important, too shocking, to treat it as business as usual. The internet is not a space free of rule of law. The rules that apply offline also need to be respected in the online world. Those companies have a great power; I want them to also bear great responsibility,” she added.
Facebook has seen its stock prices fall since details of the incident were published by the New York Times and the Observer last month.
Regulators in the US and Europe have amped up pressure on the company since the reporters were published.
The umbrella group of powerful data protection authorities from EU countries will discuss the case at a two-day plenary meeting next week (10-11 April) in Brussels.
Andrea Jelinek, the chair of the group, said last month that the EU regulators are supporting the ICO’s investigation. They could also open a joint inquiry into whether the companies broke EU data protection law in other member states.
Separately, the UK Parliament’s digital and culture committee is investigating the incident. Two former Cambridge Analytica executives and Facebook chief technology officer Mike Schroepfer will speak before the committee later this month.



EU heads of state issue warning over Facebook data case
The 28 EU heads of state issued a warning shot on Thursday (22 March) over allegations that 50 million Facebook users’ data was harvested without their consent to influence political campaigns.


            ","Personal data from around 2.7 million Facebook users in the EU was shared with analytics firm Cambridge Analytica, the European Commission announced on Friday (6 April). Facebook shared the new figure with EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova in a letter that she received Thursday evening, Commission spokesman Christian Wigand told reporters. “Unfortunately some explanations fall short of my expectations. It’s clear that data of Europeans have been exposed to a huge risk and I am not sure if Facebook took all the necessary steps to implement change,” Jourova said in a statement on Friday afternoon. The company was responding to an earlier letter that Jourova sent to the social media platform on 23 March, in which she demanded explanations about its knowledge of Cambridge Analytica’s alleged harvesting of up to 87 million Facebook users’ profiles for its work on political campaigns. Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Chris Wylie alleged last month that Facebook users’ data was analysed without their knowledge—and that the UK-based company worked for Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and the Leave campaign in the 2016 Brexit referendum. Whistleblower alleges illegal use of Facebook data swung Brexit vote Cambridge Analytica illegally rigged the 2016 Brexit referendum by harvesting Facebook profiles, a whistleblower has told MPs. Jourova will speak on the phone to Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg early next week. Wigand said the letter did not include details confirming how many Facebook users in each EU country were affected by the data harvesting. A Facebook spokeswoman said that Cambridge Analytica collected data from 1,079,031 in the UK and a total of 309,815 users in Germany. Users of the social media platform were affected in all 28 EU member states. In Italy, 214,134 users were affected, and in France, 211,667.

                The CEO of Russia’s Gazprom , Alexei Miller, said on Friday (6 April) he was proud of having been included on a new US sanctions list and that the company’s policies were right.
“Not being included in the first list I even had some doubts – may be something is wrong (with me)? But I am finally included. This means that we are doing everything right,” Miller said through his spokesman.
The United States imposed sanctions against Russian businessmen, companies and government officials, striking at associates of President Vladimir Putin in one of Washington’s most aggressive moves to punish Moscow for a range of activities, including alleged meddling in the 2016 US election.
The action, taken under pressure from the US Congress, freezes the US assets of “oligarchs” such as aluminium tycoon Oleg Deripaska, a close associate of Putin, and lawmaker Suleiman Kerimov, whose family controls Russia’s largest gold producer, Polyus.


This is huge: US sanctions Deripaska and Vekselberg (among others). Finally hitting Putin and his cronies where it counts  https://t.co/EE22gMtPjO
— Bill Browder (@Billbrowder) April 6, 2018

The sanctions are largely a reply to what US intelligence agencies say was Russian interference in the presidential election, although the Treasury Department painted them as a response to a series of adversarial actions by Moscow.
US President Donald Trump has been under fire for not taking strong action against Russia after a series of diplomatic disputes reminiscent of the Cold War era and the sanctions could complicate his hopes for good relations with Putin.
Relations already had worsened in recent months as the United States expelled Russian diplomats over a poisoning case in Britain and imposed sanctions on Russians for alleged links to cyber-attacks.
The latest sanctions are aimed at seven Russian oligarchs and 12 companies they own or control, plus 17 senior Russian government officials. They freeze the US assets of the people and companies named and forbid Americans in general from doing business with them.
Trump has faced fierce criticism – including from fellow Republicans – for doing too little to punish Russia for the election meddling, its actions in Ukraine, and its support of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria’s civil war.
US intelligence agencies last year accused Russia of using hacking and disseminating false information and propaganda to disrupt the 2016 elections and eventually try to ensure Trump defeated Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Oligarchs and elites
In addition to Deripaska and Kerimov, other businessmen on the sanctions list include Viktor Vekselberg, key owner of Renova holding group who Forbes magazine ranks as Russia’s 9th richest businessman with a net worth of $14.4 billion. He is famous for bringing back a collection of Faberge eggs to Russia.
Also targeted is Kirill Shamalov, a minority shareholder with petrochemical company Sibur. Shamalov married Putin’s youngest daughter Katerina in 2013, multiple sources who were at the wedding told Reuters. After the marriage, he swiftly grew his wealth through investments in Sibur but unconfirmed media reports say Shamalov and Putin’s daughter have since split.
Deripaska said the US decision to impose sanctions on him on Friday was “groundless, ridiculous and absurd.”
“The events this morning are very unfortunate but not unexpected,” Deripaska said in statement provided to Reuters by a spokesperson for Basic Element, one of his businesses.
“Certainly the grounds for putting my name on the list of SDNs as provided by U.S. officials are groundless, ridiculous and absurd,” he added, using the acronym for Specially Designated Nationals.
In announcing the sanctions, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement, “The Russian government operates for the disproportionate benefit of oligarchs and government elites.”
He said Moscow “engages in a range of malign activity around the globe, including continuing to occupy Crimea and instigate violence in eastern Ukraine, supplying the Assad regime with material and weaponry as they bomb their own civilians, attempting to subvert Western democracies, and malicious cyber activities.”
Russian Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev said, however, Moscow’s contacts with the US government would not be brought to an end by the sanctions. Russia denies interfering in the US election.

The sanctions could hurt the Russian economy, especially the aluminium, financial and energy sectors, and are a clear message to Putin and his inner circle of US displeasure.
Shares in some Russian companies targeted by the sanctions plummeted but the broader market and rouble showed little reaction to the new round of geopolitical tensions.
Shares in EN+ Group, which was put on the sanctions list and manages Deripaska’s aluminum and hydropower assets, were down 19.7% on the London stock exchange.
Deripaska resigned as president of EN+ in February after he was one of dozens of billionaires placed on a US government list of Russian oligarchs in January.
Rusal, a Russian aluminium giant also included on the list, fell 10% on the Moscow Exchange.
Douglas Jacobson, an attorney with Jacobson Burton Kelley firm in Washington, D.C., said that while the sanctions prohibit US banks from helping the companies targeted on Friday raise capital, most other international Western banks also are likely to also follow suit.
“These companies now are radioactive,” he said.
Russian state companies under the US sanctions will receive additional government support, Russian Industry and Trade Minister Denis Manturov said, according to Interfax.
Russia and Trump
Senator Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, urged Trump to set out steps “to deter Kremlin aggression” against the United States and its allies.
“Nearly 15 months into this administration, the American people and our allies are still questioning whether the president is willing to fully defend our democracy and our national security,” said Menendez, co-author of the law under which Friday’s sanctions were imposed.
US Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating whether Trump’s election campaign colluded with Russia, something that Trump denies. Mueller has indicted 13 Russians and three organizations in his probe.



Trump could be interviewed within weeks in Russia probe
President Donald Trump could be interviewed within weeks as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election, the Washington Post reported yesterday (8 January).


Daniel Fried, the US government’s former coordinator of sanctions policy under former President Barack Obama, said the sanctions list “is a solid piece of work.”
“It doesn’t do anything dumb, like go after Russian gas exports. It goes after oligarchs that deserve it,” said Fried, now at the Atlantic Council in Washington.
Elizabeth Rosenberg, a former senior US Treasury Department official, said the sanctions were significant, although there is more to do.
“I would hasten to say that Russia hawks may welcome this but wouldn’t find it satisfying. And by no means would this be the sum total of what the US government should do to advance its concerns,” said Rosenberg, now a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security think tank.
Trump angered many members of Congress by failing for months to implement sanctions on Russia that lawmakers passed nearly unanimously last year.
But pressure for the United States to take action against Russia, especially from US lawmakers, has been increasing.
Putin’s government has been blamed for the poisoning of a former Russian double agent living in Britain last month and the United States and several European states announced plans to expel more than 100 Russian diplomats in response.



Germany’s Russia expert warns against new ‘Cold War’
Germany wants to keep up a dialogue with Moscow despite joining Western expulsions of Russian diplomats and must avoid a new Cold War, the German government’s coordinator for Russia said in a newspaper interview.


In February, the White House blamed Russia for the international “NotPetya” cyber-attack, which has been called the most destructive and costly in history.
On March 15, the Trump administration said it would impose sanctions on 19 people and five entities, including Russian intelligence services, for cyber-attacks stretching back at least two years.


Good news that the US has sanctioned more Russian oligarchs.   But until we take down the money-laundering vehicles that enriched them – the shell companies, the tax havens, the real estate schemes – I don't think it means much. https://t.co/JOmerZPFb7

                There is little doubt that the winner of the snap presidential election in Azerbaijan on Wednesday (11 April) will be its incumbent head of state, Ilham Aliyev. More interesting is the motive for such a move – which may well be the wish to counter the consolidation of power in arch-foe Armenia.
Azerbaijan’s strongman Aliyev called in February a snap presidential ballot for 11 April, six months ahead of schedule. The oil-rich country was initially set to hold the vote on 17 October and the surprise decision sparked strong criticism from opposition parties.



Azerbaijan calls snap presidential poll for April
Azerbaijan’s strongman Ilham Aliyev called on Monday (5 February) a snap presidential vote for 11 April, six months ahead of schedule, as opposition politicians slammed the surprise move.


The real intrigue is however in the balancing act with Armenia, a neighbour with which Azerbaijan is technically at war over the Nagorno-Karabakh region.
Ethnic Armenians backed by Yerevan seized control of Nagorno-Karabakh from Azerbaijan in the early 1990s, in a war that left an estimated 30,000 dead. The two sides never signed a definitive peace deal and all attempts to negotiate a final settlement have stalled.
In April 2016, at least 110 people were killed in Nagorno-Karabakh on all sides as the simmering violence escalated into the worst clashes in decades.
The second and final term in office of Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan ends in April 2018. Since 2015, Sargsyan has been pushing controversial constitutional amendments designed to curb presidential powers and boost the post of prime minister, which he appears keen to take up.



Armenia lawmakers elect president as Sargsyan eyes 'super' powers as PM
Armenian lawmakers today (2 March) will elect a largely ceremonial president to succeed Serzh Sargsyan as he seeks to extend his grip on power under a new parliamentary system of government.


President-elect Armen Sargsyan (not a relative to Serzh Sargsyan), will be sworn as the new head of state on Monday (9 April), at a special parliament session in Yerevan. In March, parliament elected Armen Sargsyan, who had been Armenia’s ambassador to London, to be the next head of state.
Armenian media stress that the new president will have a mostly ceremonial role, with the real executive power vested in the prime minister, who will also be chosen by parliament a week later.
He will be the country’s de facto leader—in charge of the economy, foreign and security policy. Sargsyan has previously denied wanting the job but all indications are that he will take it.
According to diplomatic sources, Aliyev’s move to consolidate his own power quickly in Azerbaijan must be seen as an effort to avoid uncertainty that could destabilise the fragile relations between the two former Soviet republics.
In a recent article, Carnegie Europe described Sargsyan as a shrewd politician “who plays the long game”. Armenia, which is militarily less strong than Azerbaijan, bases its security on being an ally of Russia and a member of its Eurasian union.

Armenia has been traditionally successful in working with its large diaspora on promoting a positive image of the country abroad and criticising Azerbaijan.
Both countries have issues in areas of human rights and press freedom, corruption and cronyism. Western-style democracy is hardly achievable in Armenia and Azerbaijan in the medium term. Azerbaijan’s economy, however, is doing much better.
The EU is relying on Azerbaijan for the Southern Gas Corridor, a project to carry offshore Azeri gas across Turkey to Europe by 2020.
Azerbaijan has the best of relations with Turkey. In contrast, Armenia’s relations with Ankara continue to deteriorate. Last month, Armenia scrapped a peace agreement it had  signed with Turkey in 2009 in a failed attempt to normalise relations between the two countries. Their border remains closed.
The EU leverage in both Armenia and Azerbaijan is limited, given that neither country is seeking the status of association, already obtained by Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia. For Armenia, this is hardly possible, because of its relations with Russia. Rich in fossil fuels, Azerbaijan does not want to be bound either way.
In a recent interview with the Russian agency TASS, Aliyev described Azerbaijan as a self-sufficient country free of economic difficulties and capable of implementing an independent policy. He said that over the past 15 years, Azerbaijan’s economy had grown by 3.5 times, which he said was probably a world record.
He added that Azerbaijan’s currency reserves make up the same volume as the annual gross domestic product.

Armenian media stress that the new president will have a mostly ceremonial role, with the real executive power vested in the prime minister, who will also be chosen by parliament a week later. He will be the country’s de facto leader—in charge of the economy, foreign and security policy. Sargsyan has previously denied wanting the job but all indications are that he will take it. According to diplomatic sources, Aliyev’s move to consolidate his own power quickly in Azerbaijan must be seen as an effort to avoid uncertainty that could destabilise the fragile relations between the two former Soviet republics. In a recent article, Carnegie Europe described Sargsyan as a shrewd politician “who plays the long game”. Armenia, which is militarily less strong than Azerbaijan, bases its security on being an ally of Russia and a member of its Eurasian union. ""Some pro-government Armenians cite the volatility of the #Karabakh conflict as one reason why the country needs Sargsyan to continue, as a steady head on the tiller."" Read more on the future of #Armenia after the constitutional reforms from @Tom_deWaal: https://t.co/ZZB2pslweU — Carnegie Europe (@Carnegie_Europe) April 9, 2018 Armenia has been traditionally successful in working with its large diaspora on promoting a positive image of the country abroad and criticising Azerbaijan. Both countries have issues in areas of human rights and press freedom, corruption and cronyism. Western-style democracy is hardly achievable in Armenia and Azerbaijan in the medium term. Azerbaijan’s economy, however, is doing much better. The EU is relying on Azerbaijan for the Southern Gas Corridor, a project to carry offshore Azeri gas across Turkey to Europe by 2020. Azerbaijan has the best of relations with Turkey. In contrast, Armenia’s relations with Ankara continue to deteriorate. Last month, Armenia scrapped a peace agreement it had signed with Turkey in 2009 in a failed attempt to normalise relations between the two countries. Their border remains closed. The EU leverage in both Armenia and Azerbaijan is limited, given that neither country is seeking the status of association, already obtained by Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia. For Armenia, this is hardly possible, because of its relations with Russia. Rich in fossil fuels, Azerbaijan does not want to be bound either way. In a recent interview with the Russian agency TASS, Aliyev described Azerbaijan as a self-sufficient country free of economic difficulties and capable of implementing an independent policy. He said that over the past 15 years, Azerbaijan’s economy had grown by 3.5 times, which he said was probably a world record. He added that Azerbaijan’s currency reserves make up the same volume as the annual gross domestic product.",130

                Hungary’s anti-immigration Prime Minister Viktor Orbán basked Monday (9 April) in a bulldozer election triumph that delighted other nationalists but sent a chill through civil society groups and portended fresh battles with Brussels.
After a campaign centred on resistance to immigration and trumpeting a strong economy, nearly complete results showed that Orbán’s Fidesz party snapped up almost half the vote (48.8%).
This will give it a two-thirds majority in parliament and a legislative carte blanche to pursue Orbán’s transformation of the central European country into what he calls an “illiberal democracy”.



Orbán wins legitimacy to continue challenging Brussels
Prime Minister Viktor Orbán won a third straight term in power in Sunday elections (8 April) after his anti-immigration campaign message secured a strong majority for his party in parliament, granting him two-thirds of seats based on preliminary results.


Addressing ecstatic, flag-waving supporters in Budapest late on Sunday, Orbán said the “destiny-deciding victory” setting him up for a third straight term gave Hungarians “the opportunity to defend themselves and to defend Hungary”.
Opposition parties, which entered the final weeks of the campaign with some optimism, saw their hopes dashed that a high turnout and cooperation in some constituencies might damage Orbán.
The head and founder of the far-right Jobbik, Gábor Vona, who has sought to moderate the party, said late Monday that its board had accepted his resignation after it won only 19.3% of the vote.
Orbán’s win followed strong election performances from other parties portraying themselves as anti-system such as in Italy in March and in Austria and Germany last year.
Far-right praise 
OSCE monitors said that “xenophobic rhetoric” and “media bias” in the campaign impaired voters’ ability to make a fully informed choice. The public broadcaster “clearly favoured the ruling coalition”.

Gergely Gulyas, the head of Fidesz in parliament, rejected the respected international monitoring body’s report.
“It is not their task to give a political opinion on the Hungarian election campaign… and to judge the government’s campaign,” he said.
Meanwhile congratulations from allies poured in for Orbán, long a thorn in the EU’s side, who styles himself as the defender of Christian Europe against the “poison” of immigration and the “globalist elite”.

In Poland, whose government like Hungary’s has clashed with Brussels over worries about the rule of law, right-wing Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki wished Orbán success “for Hungary and for Europe”.
Poland’s deputy foreign minister said the win confirmed central Europe’s “emancipation” while anti-migrant Czech President Milos Zeman’s spokesman hailed “another defeat for the dehumanised politics and hate media”.
Beatrix von Storch from the Alternative for Germany (AfD) said it was a “bad day for the EU and a good one for Europe”.
“Hungary voted with its heart and its head, ignoring threats from Brussels,” said Matteo Salvini, head of Italy’s far-right League and potentially the next prime minister there.

Juncker’s spokesman Margaritis Schinas said the former Luxembourg PM would congratulate Orbán in a letter and phone call, but also struck a warning note.
“The European Union is a union of democracies and values. President Juncker and the commission believe that the defence of these values and principles is a common duty for all member states, without exception,” Schinas said.
In a terse congratulatory note, Tusk told Orbán he was counting on him to “play a constructive role in maintaining our unity in the EU”.

The EU has launched a barrage of legal action against Orbán’s government, taking it to the bloc’s top court over a crackdown on education and foreign-backed civil society groups that critics say targets US billionaire George Soros.
The European Commission has also brought a case against Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic over their refusal to accept quotas for asylum seekers.
But Orbán has remained defiant in the face of both criticism and legal action from Brussels and the bloc faces a challenge in trying to either cajole or compel him to cooperate.
Joachim Fritz-Vannahme, an analyst with the Bertelsmann Stiftung thinktank, said Orbán’s win could be an unpleasant foretaste for Brussels of next year’s elections to the European Parliament.
“We already have almost a third of MEPs who are anti-Europe or eurosceptic, from UKIP to Marine Le Pen,” he told AFP.
“If we take the results in Italy, Hungary and Austria it’s clear there is a very strong anti-European current which is going to dominate the character and temperament of the next European Parliament.”


Orban's win in Hungary is a huge threat to the existence of the EU. They can not ignore a fascist with a popular mandate. The EU will have to act or die. Poland will be next if they fail.

‘Talk straight to him’ 
Orbán’s Fidesz party is part of the European People’s Party (EPP), the dominant force in the European Parliament which also includes German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s CDU party, and some critics say this has given him political cover in Brussels.
On Monday Manfred Weber, the head of the EPP bloc in the parliament, congratulated Orbán on Twitter, saying he was looking forward to “continuing working with you towards common solutions to our European challenges”.


Congratulations to Viktor #Orban and #Fideszmpsz on their clear victory in the #HungaryElections. I look forward to continuing working with you towards common solutions to our European challenges. @EPPGroup #EPP
— Manfred Weber (@ManfredWeber) April 9, 2018

Left-leaning groups in parliament condemned the EPP’s support for Orbán, with German MEP Sylvia-Yvonne Kaufmann, of the Socialists and Democrats, saying they needed to “talk straight to him, instead of flattering him with visits and invitations”.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel also congratulated Orbán, with her spokesman saying that despite differences, Berlin wanted cooperation “within the European framework and the values that unite us”.
Rising star 
Orbán, 54, became a household name as a young student in 1989 in the dying days of communism with a stirring speech demanding that Soviet troops go home.
As one of the brightest stars in newly democratic “new” Europe, Orbán co-founded Fidesz and anchored it firmly in the centre right with a focus on family and Christian values.
The father-of-five learned from a rocky first term as prime minister from 1998-2002. He bounced back in 2010 with a two-thirds majority, a feat he repeated four years later.
He shook up the judiciary, brought state media under tighter control and tacked hard right during Europe’s 2015 migrant crisis, building razor-wire anti-migrant fences on Hungary’s borders with Serbia and Croatia.
During the recent election campaign he ramped up his attacks on financier and philanthropist George Soros as the malign mastermind of a “global elite” in cahoots with the EU to let in floods of foreigners.
At the same time, Orbán has cultivated friendly ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin. He also dismisses Hungary being ranked the EU’s second-most corrupt country by Transparency International.
‘Dark shadow’ 
Non-governmental organisations, particularly those funded by Soros — who helped get Fidesz off the ground — have found life particularly hard, and on Monday were bracing for even tougher times.
Fidesz spokesman Janos Halasz said on television that bills from a new “Stop Soros” package of legislation would be among the first to go before the new parliament.
Daniel Hegedus, research adviser at Freedom House, said Orbán’s new victory casts a “dark shadow on the future, especially concerning the attacks against the critical civil society”.
Elisabeth Katalin Grabow, a Hungarian-German journalist, said she and her Ghanaian boyfriend are fearful.
“How could we have children in this country, where hate and racism are now officially part of the governing party’s policy?” she said.
But others were more upbeat.
“Business is good, I have contacts everywhere and I don’t care about civil rights,” construction supplies merchant Janos Kevei, 41, told AFP. “Why change something that’s working so well?”

                Commission First Vice President Frans Timmermans on Monday (9 April) urged Poland to step up efforts at finding a solution to a high-pitched dispute over its controversial judicial reforms, denounced by Brussels as violating the rule of law.
“This is not something that we want to drag out for months and months; we need now to try to come to solutions as quickly as possible,” Timmermans told reporters in Warsaw.

Brussels in December triggered Article 7 of the EU treaty over what it sees as “systemic threats” to the independence of the Polish judiciary from the country’s rightwing government — a move that could lead to never-before-used sanctions.
Poland, the biggest ex-communist EU state, stands accused of subjecting courts to more government control since the nationalist-minded, eurosceptical Law and Justice (PiS) party won power in late 2015.
Under the overhaul, the justice minister was given the power to fire court heads without providing justification and subject to no review. Among other measures, PiS also decided to cut the terms of Supreme Court judges, retiring 40% of them.
The new Supreme Court judges will be appointed by the president who is a PiS ally. This politicised Supreme Court will decide directly about the validity of election results.
Last month PiS offered some concessions in the spat with the EU, but the Supreme Court called the changes “illusory”.



Juncker ‘will assess’ Poland’s anti-Article 7 warnings
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki on Thursday (8 March) handed Brussels a detailed defence of Warsaw’s controversial judicial reforms and warned that any EU disciplinary action could deepen a “populist” backlash.


Warsaw says the changes were necessary to push aside judges left over from the Communist era. It also says that the reforms will improve the way and speed courts in Poland function.
Poland’s government, rejecting claims that its reforms dismantle the separation of powers enshrined in EU treaties, has argued the changes are necessary to remove the last vestiges of communism from its justice system.
Poland had three months to reply to the EU’s concerns. The foreign ministry said in March that it had met the deadline, without specifying the contents of its response.
A lawmaker from the governing Law and Justice (PiS) party, Marek Ast, however, announced that a draft law would be introduced to slightly modify the reforms.
The opposition denounced the changes as merely cosmetic.
“I have sensed a strong will on the side of the Polish government to come to solutions; there is a strong will also on the side of the commission,” said Timmermans at a joint press conference with Poland’s foreign minister after a day of talks with senior officials.
“But the proof of the pudding will be in the eating and the pudding is not the table yet,” he added.
For his part, Polish Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz warned that “there is the danger that we will propose solutions and that the European Commission will remain unsatisfied”.
Czaputowicz added that “it’s too soon today to say for sure whether a compromise will be found and what it will look like.”
The stakes are high if Warsaw fails to satisfy Brussels.
It could be stripped of voting rights in the bloc under the Article 7 procedure — covering systemic threats to the rule of law — which has never been used against an EU state.
However, Poland’s ally Hungary, which has also clashed with Brussels over democracy issues, has vowed to veto any sanction.



Rule of law: Chance for compromise between Warsaw and Brussels?
Members of Poland’s Law and Justice (PiS) party have proposed amendments to the controversial laws governing the Polish judicial system that put Warsaw in the crosshairs of the European Commission. It is still unclear if these changes will soothe the dispute or if they are just empty gestures. EURACTIV Poland reports.

                Twenty-four EU countries pledged to band together to form a “European approach” to artificial intelligence in a bid to compete with American and Asian tech giants.
Ministers signed a declaration on Tuesday (10 April) saying they will consider putting public research funding into AI, but did not promise a specific amount of dedicated new investments.
All EU member states except for Cyprus, Romania, Croatia and Greece vowed to “modernise national policies” as part of an effort to develop large-scale AI research.
One Commission official said the four EU countries that did not sign were not opposed to the initiative but might still need formal approval before signing. Norway also signed the declaration.
European politicians are scrambling to amp up their work on AI by earmarking public funds and nudging companies to invest in technologies like robotics and medical applications that process huge amounts of data.
The EU’s investment in AI lags behind the US and China, and the bloc’s new initiative could still be hampered by competition between member states, or by their differing positions on regulation.
EU Digital Commissioner Mariya Gabriel will publish a strategy paper on AI on 25 April that she said will outline legal issues that the technology is likely to create, and also address fears about robots replacing jobs. She will not propose binding legislation focused on AI this month, but has not ruled out regulating the technology at a later point.



Gabriel: Facebook users 'need to know what happened with their data'
Facebook users “need to know what happened with their data” following reports over a week ago that millions of profiles on the social media platform were secretly used to help political campaigns, EU Digital Commissioner Mariya Gabriel said.


National governments have made a rush of recent announcements relating to AI. French President Emmanuel Macron was the latest leader to focus on the technology when he revealed a plan last month to pump a total of €1.5 billion in public funding into AI research over the next four years. Macron has also met recently with big tech executives to lure jobs and private investment to France. Facebook already runs an AI research lab in Paris.
In its coalition agreement from February, Germany’s new government committed to setting up its own research unit and a joint AI centre with France.
Gabriel called for EU countries to work more together to compete with bigger competitors in the United States and Asia.
“Member states have a level of excellence in some sectors but they cannot be globally leading in an isolated way if they’re alone. The EU can be a driving force,” she told reporters on the sidelines of a Brussels conference focused on investment in technology and AI on Tuesday.
Gabriel said that competition between member states to attract multinational companies would not threaten the EU’s effort to coordinate national policies and research on AI.
“If there are any disagreements, I believe this is something that can be valuable for the EU,” she said.
In addition to considering changes to national laws and new investment funds in AI, the ministers committed to starting up pan-European research centres.
They also agreed that humans should “remain at the centre of the development, deployment and decision-making of AI” and vowed to “prevent the harmful creation and use of AI applications”.
Ministers who signed the declaration said they want the EU as a whole to compete with the US and China on developing new AI technologies.
Speaking on a panel discussion with other countries’ ministers at the same conference, Mounir Mahjoubi, France’s secretary of state for digital affairs, said that his country’s €1.5 billion investment pledge is not only in France’s interests.
“France wants Europe to be the leader on AI,” Mahjoubi said.



Macron eyes AI at European level
Emmanuel Macron unveiled the French strategy for artificial intelligence, stressing the need for Europe to get on board. 


Several ministers emphasised that the EU should agree on ethical standards on AI that could give European companies an advantage over competitors.
“We can’t expect China to do that. We have to do that. With a democracy and a legal system that works, Europe has to take that as the most important thing. The competition with China, the competition with the US, is of course important. But if we don’t create the legal and ethical framework, we will lose anyway,” said Peter Eriksson, Sweden’s minister for digital development.
In a separate paper that Hungary, Slovakia, Poland and the Czech Republic circulated on Tuesday, the countries called for EU-level tests of new technologies before any new regulation is proposed.
“Even though the emergence of new legislation is inevitable, we must ensure it is drafted wisely,” one central European diplomat said.
The four countries also signed the declaration backed by other member states. Their paper is open to other countries who want to back the document.
“Some member states have their own agenda,” said Georgios Petropoulos, a research fellow at the Bruegel think tank. He pointed to Germany’s announcement that it will start a national research initiative on AI and a new centre with France as examples of the country’s emphasis on national interests.
Petropoulos called the declaration between 24 EU member states “very important” because it reflects ministers’ understanding that joint investment programmes and an EU-wide approach to any future regulation will help the bloc compete with other regions.
“The scale of investments, the scale of developments, is something that goes beyond the possibilities that one member state alone has,” he said.
“If we want as Europe to grasp the full benefits from that, we need to have joint investments that will be on a scale comparable to the US and China, which are really already exploiting possibilities of these technologies.”



Millennials see robots as job creators rather than a threat
Young people remain optimistic about the impact of robots and artificial intelligence in the work place, as a large majority of them believe that more jobs will be created than will disappear, according to a global poll published on Monday (28 August).


            ","Twenty-four EU countries pledged to band together to form a “European approach” to artificial intelligence in a bid to compete with American and Asian tech giants. Ministers signed a declaration on Tuesday (10 April) saying they will consider putting public research funding into AI, but did not promise a specific amount of dedicated new investments. All EU member states except for Cyprus, Romania, Croatia and Greece vowed to “modernise national policies” as part of an effort to develop large-scale AI research. One Commission official said the four EU countries that did not sign were not opposed to the initiative but might still need formal approval before signing. Norway also signed the declaration. European politicians are scrambling to amp up their work on AI by earmarking public funds and nudging companies to invest in technologies like robotics and medical applications that process huge amounts of data. The EU’s investment in AI lags behind the US and China, and the bloc’s new initiative could still be hampered by competition between member states, or by their differing positions on regulation. EU Digital Commissioner Mariya Gabriel will publish a strategy paper on AI on 25 April that she said will outline legal issues that the technology is likely to create, and also address fears about robots replacing jobs. She will not propose binding legislation focused on AI this month, but has not ruled out regulating the technology at a later point. Gabriel: Facebook users 'need to know what happened with their data' Facebook users “need to know what happened with their data” following reports over a week ago that millions of profiles on the social media platform were secretly used to help political campaigns, EU Digital Commissioner Mariya Gabriel said. National governments have made a rush of recent announcements relating to AI. French President Emmanuel Macron was the latest leader to focus on the technology when he revealed a plan last month to pump a total of €1.5 billion in public funding into AI research over the next four years. Macron has also met recently with big tech executives to lure jobs and private investment to France. Facebook already runs an AI research lab in Paris. In its coalition agreement from February, Germany’s new government committed to setting up its own research unit and a joint AI centre with France. Gabriel called for EU countries to work more together to compete with bigger competitors in the United States and Asia. “Member states have a level of excellence in some sectors but they cannot be globally leading in an isolated way if they’re alone. The EU can be a driving force,” she told reporters on the sidelines of a Brussels conference focused on investment in technology and AI on Tuesday. Gabriel said that competition between member states to attract multinational companies would not threaten the EU’s effort to coordinate national policies and research on AI. “If there are any disagreements, I believe this is something that can be valuable for the EU,” she said. In addition to considering changes to national laws and new investment funds in AI, the ministers committed to starting up pan-European research centres. They also agreed that humans should “remain at the centre of the development, deployment and decision-making of AI” and vowed to “prevent the harmful creation and use of AI applications”. Ministers who signed the declaration said they want the EU as a whole to compete with the US and China on developing new AI technologies. Speaking on a panel discussion with other countries’ ministers at the same conference, Mounir Mahjoubi, France’s secretary of state for digital affairs, said that his country’s €1.5 billion investment pledge is not only in France’s interests. “France wants Europe to be the leader on AI,” Mahjoubi said. Macron eyes AI at European level Emmanuel Macron unveiled the French strategy for artificial intelligence, stressing the need for Europe to get on board. Several ministers emphasised that the EU should agree on ethical standards on AI that could give European companies an advantage over competitors. “We can’t expect China to do that. We have to do that. With a democracy and a legal system that works, Europe has to take that as the most important thing. The competition with China, the competition with the US, is of course important. But if we don’t create the legal and ethical framework, we will lose anyway,” said Peter Eriksson, Sweden’s minister for digital development.

                The Czech president has advised Prime Minister Andrej Babiš to try to negotiate a new government with two fringe parties after coalition talks with the Social Democrats collapsed, Babiš said yesterday (11 April).
President Miloš Zeman recommended that Babiš, a billionaire businessman who leads the ANO party, should revive his previous attempts to form a coalition with the Communists (KSCM) and far-right, anti-European Union SPD party.
Babiš won an election last October but has yet to muster enough support to win a parliamentary confidence vote. Talks with the Social Democrats, who led a previous coalition government that included ANO, fell apart last week in a row over ministries.



Thousands protest against Czech PM Babiš as government talks stall
Thousands of Czechs rallied on Monday (9 April) to call for the resignation of Prime Minister Andrej Babiš, battling police charges and without parliamentary backing for his government.


“The president recommended to me to continue negotiations with KSCM and SPD,” Babiš told reporters after meeting Zeman at the presidential retreat in Lany, 40 km (25 miles) west of Prague.
Zeman’s attitude to the European Union echoes populist-minded eastern EU leaders – especially in Hungary and Poland – at odds with Brussels over mandatory refugee quotas and various rules which they see as attempts to limit national sovereignty. He is also openly pro-Putin and  stridently anti-Muslim, having once called the 2015 migrant crisis “an organised invasion” of Europe and insisted Muslims were “impossible to integrate”.



Czechs look East as pro-Russian Zeman wins re-election
The Czech Republic was looking east on Sunday after the Kremlin and Beijing were among the first to congratulate populist President Miloš Zeman on his re-election in a cliffhanger vote.


A number of parties have shunned Babiš mainly due to criminal charges which he is facing over an alleged fraud of EU subsidies worth €2 million a decade ago. He denies any wrongdoing.



Czech PM Babiš battles fraud charges as cabinet loses confidence vote
Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babiš’s minority government lost a confidence vote yesterday (16 January), forcing him to try to cut a deal with opposition parties to stay in office while he also battles allegations of subsidy fraud.


However, the two fringe parties are problematic as the Communists want the Czech Republic to leave the NATO defence alliance and SPD (Freedom and Direct Democracy, led by Tomio Okamura) has called for the country to quit the EU, pushing for a referendum similar to when Britons voted for Brexit in 2016.

                To ensure the security and stability of the Western Balkans, the perspective of membership may no longer be enough. The EU should push back against Russian propaganda and engage in smarter outreach. It needs a new, more confident approach, writes Sir Graham Watson.
Sir Graham Watson was an MEP from 1994 to 2014. He led the European Parliament’s Liberal Democrats from 2002 to 2009 and presided over the ALDE Party from 2011 to 2015. He is now a member of the European Economic and Social Committee and also advises the consultancy APCO Worldwide.
The remarkable persistence of the postwar peace in Western Europe, secured for three generations by the mortar of the European Union around the bricks of NATO, now faces ructions from within and predations from outwith. The thunderclouds on the political landscape are rejoined by the lightning flashes from geopolitics. The legacy of peace cannot be secured through seeking shelter in national silos.
Remarkably, in responding to external threats, the tendency of EU member states has been to pull together. The recent nerve gas poisoning of a Russian double agent in Salisbury highlights the importance of cooperation and diplomacy for the stability and security of the European Union. That it should be called for by a country leaving the EU simply highlights the need for the Union itself.
One needs to be neither a cold-warrior nor a conspiracy theorist to see how Russia has been more evident recently on our doorsteps. It has intervened militarily in Ukraine and through soft power in the Southern Caucasus. 
Now it competes with the EU for a role in the Western Balkans, active even in the politics of EU member states in that region, building on close historical and cultural ties and taking advantage of political and economic difficulties to expand its influence. Indeed, Russia’s reach is registered from Tiraspol to Tirana.
Moscow’s meddling is working. Public support in the region for EU accession is in decline. As EU foreign policy suprema Federica Mogherini said in March of last year, political instabilities in Western Balkan countries run the risk of the region becoming a chessboard in the geopolitical confrontation between Russia and the West.
It is fortunate, then, that the current Presidency of the EU is held by a Balkan country. Bulgaria has put the needs of Western Balkans firmly back on the EU agenda. And after a long period of “enlargement fatigue”, there is renewed political awareness in Brussels of the need to respond to the European ambitions of the victims of our continent’s most recent armed conflict.
In a moment which confirmed the decline of Christian democracy post-Kohl, Juncker in his 2014 acceptance speech ruled out further EU enlargement under his Commission, and emphasised the sentiment of “enlargement fatigue”.
Now, in its Presidency programme, Bulgaria insists on EU enlargement as a key priority. It committed to be a Balkan Presidency and to work on giving the Western Balkans a clear European perspective. There is an action plan for each of the countries, without creating unrealistic expectations, but with concrete steps. 
Dialogue is a crucial element in this process, so Borissov’s Bulgarian Presidency is organising an informal Summit of the heads of state and government in May. Fifteen years after Thessaloniki, the six western Balkan leaders will meet their EU counterparts. 
For Bulgarians, Balkan integration is very important – for investment opportunities, labour supply and connectivity – but also to honour promises of progress on the path to the EU. Bulgaria knows too its importance for European stability. 
As the country-specific reports due for publication on 17 April will show, support for EU membership in the Western Balkans remains strong but is vulnerable to erosion. It is strongest of all in Albania, which is turning the corner on the past and developing a good track record in countering terrorism and organised crime. 
Its “National Strategy on Countering Violent Extremism” is designed to dovetail with the EU’s Western Balkan Counter-Terrorism Initiative. Some question whether Albania should get approval to start negotiations from Commission and Council. Questioning the cost of denying such cooperation sheds more light on the challenge we face.
The perspective of membership may no longer be enough. The EU should push-back against Russian propaganda and engage in smarter outreach. It should better advertise the existing extent of EU engagement and impact of its presence. 
It should recognise that all six countries together have a population of only 18 million. And that we cannot separate economic integration from the security agenda. A new, more confident approach is needed.

                MEPs are demanding the launch of an infringement procedure against Hungary for breaching ‘core EU values’, just days after Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s sweeping election success.
The demand is made in a draft report by the European Parliament’s Civil Liberties Committee, published on Thursday (12 April), which lists 12 breaches. These include the weakening of the Constitutional Court and the judiciary, corruption, restrictions on freedom of expression, assembly and intimidation of the media, non-governmental organizations and research institutions.
It also expresses concerns over violations of fundamental rights of refugees and minorities.
Due to “the existence of a clear risk of a serious breach by Hungary of the values on which the Union is founded”, the report calls on EU leaders to trigger Article 7 of the EU treaty, a process that could end with the suspension of Hungary’s voting rights.
Article 7, nicknamed the Nuclear Option, has already been instigated against Poland, another ex-communist Eastern member, but has so far been stuck in the preliminary stages, with little appetite among other countries to activate sanctions procedures.
“The time of merely issuing warnings has passed. We need to stand up for the Hungarian people whose rights have been undermined by their government,” Green MEP Judith Sargentini, who authored the report, said in a video statement.

Hungarian people want to 'stop Soros', Orbán says
Hungary’s nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said Tuesday (10 April) that his resounding election win, challenged by the opposition, shows that voters want to stop US billionaire philanthropist George Soros interfering in the country.


It is the first time that an MEP has given official advice to start an Article 7 procedure.
The Civil Liberties Committee was tasked in May 2017 with assessing whether an infringement procedure against Hungary would be appropriate.
Since then, the Dutch rapporteur and her colleagues have conducted a series of interviews with experts, academics, representatives of the Hungarian government, the Venice Commission and NGOs, and evaluated documents on the state of the rule of law in the country.
“We have been seeing for years that Viktor Orbán, the Hungarian prime minister, is shifting aside all the standards and values of the European Union,” said another Green MEP, Bart Staes.
“Various investigations by independent international organizations show that the Hungarian rule of law has rapidly deteriorated due to the policies of the Hungarian government,” Staes said, adding that “if a country clearly no longer subscribes to the shared values, it must be acted upon before it goes down to an authoritarian regime.”



Timmermans urges quick solution to Poland's court reform dispute
Commission First Vice President Frans Timmermans on Monday (9 April) urged Poland to step up efforts at finding a solution to a high-pitched dispute over its controversial judicial reforms, denounced by Brussels as violating the rule of law.


The Committee will vote on Sargentini’s proposal in June. The report will then be put to a vote by the Parliament in September. To be adopted, it will need two-thirds of the votes cast and an absolute majority of MEPs.

However, it is unlikely that the report will have any real consequences for Budapest. Hungary’s ruling Fidesz party belongs to the conservative European People’s Party, the most powerful camp in the Parliament, which has so far been reluctant to condemn Orban’s policies.
Moreover, a suspension of voting rights has to be agreed in unanimity. Hungary has already said it would veto any such attempt against Poland, and Warsaw is likely to reciprocate in support of Budapest. But there is also a possibility of voting Article 7 on Poland and Hungary simultaneously, and in this case both countries have no right to vote.

                The leaders of the EU institutions received the new Kyrgyzstan President Sooronbay Jeenbekov on Thursday (12 April) for talks that focused on steadily improving relations between the countries of Central Asia and the negotiation of a new Kyrgyzstan-EU agreement.
Jeenbekov won the presidential elections on 15 October 2017 with 54.7% of the vote, against 33.7 percent for Omurbek Babanov, another ex-prime minister and one of the wealthiest businessmen in the country.
In a statement after the meeting, Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said he had congratulated Jeenbekov once again on his victory and added that the election outcome hadn’t been contested, which he said was “something not normal in the world we live in”.
A report by Freedom House published on Wednesday ranked Kyrgyzstan as “consolidated authoritarian regime”. Freedom House is a US-based government-sponsored NGO which evaluates the quality of democracy in the countries of Eastern Europe,
The country report on Kyrgyzstan says that the peaceful transition of power through elections could not disguise serious problems in the quality of political competition, and the presence of multiple parties in the parliament did not result in political pluralism.
Juncker said the two sides had started negotiations for a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement.
Among the five countries of Central Asia, (Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan), the EU has the most advanced relations with Kazakhstan, with which it signed an Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement in December.
Juncker said he had invited his guest to step up the fight against corruption and improve the situation with human rights and press freedom. He also said he had gladly accepted the invitation to visit Kyrgyzstan. “I am sure Kyrgyzstan has something to say to the world”, Juncker said.
Speaking in Russian, Jeenbekov said his visit was proof that his country considers the relations with the EU as a priority. He said Kyrgyzstan sees the EU as an important partner for its sustainable development and that Bishkek is ready for closer relations.
He said that the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement was of crucial importance for economic cooperation, but also for regional security and for strengthening democracy, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law in his country.
As journalists did not ask any questions, Juncker said he wanted to add “a word of sympathy for the people of Kyrgyzstan.
“I would like Europe to support them in all their efforts and all their ambitions. Everything that concerns Kyrgyzstan doesn’t leave the EU indifferent,” Juncker said.

                Football can be a force for good and democratisation but it can also shelter some of the worst aspects of society, like corruption and money laundering to mask illegal activities, warns MEP Stelios Kouloglou.
Stelios Kouloglou is a writer and has been an MEP since 2015 (GUE/NGL). He is the founder and former director of news site Tvxs.gr. 
Football has always had a political dimension. A 1969 war between Honduras and El Salvador was triggered by a match, while after an infamous 1942 final in occupied Kiev, between a German team and a team of excellent Soviets, the latter were arrested, tortured and some of them executed because they decided to win against the Germans, despite Nazi orders.
Sometimes, football has also been a means of democratisation. By the dawn of the last century, football in Brazil was a white men’s privilege and people of colour had to paint their faces white in order to play.
Racism in Brazilian football was confronted in the 1950s when virtuoso players like Garrincha and Pele took to the field. In fact, Pele is considered to have helped tackle the racist prejudices in Brazilian society in general.
Nowadays, though, this democratic aspect of sports is endangered. Let’s take for instance the Champions League. Only clubs from the five richest countries (Spain, Italy, France, Germany and Great Britain) can now reach the semi-finals or the finals, due to the immense amounts that they are able to spend on buying the best players.
Nowadays, where an economic oligarchy controls everything from politics to sports, huge amounts of money are invested in clubs but nobody asks where the money comes from. It might be that investing in clubs is a way of laundering money that comes from illegal activities, like drug trafficking, arm sales or tax fraud and evasion.
Clubs and players are also using multiple tax evasion schemes. Clubs from the “Big 5” spent in three months $3.67 billion in transfers, but only 36.6% of them included a transfer fee. “Football leaks” also revealed that famous footballers, like Messi, have avoided paying taxes from their astronomical incomes.
In the PANA Committee, the European Parliament’s Inquiry Committee for the Panama Papers revelations, representatives of FIFA and UEFA were invited to testify. I persistently asked them how they are going to tackle the tax avoidance schemes and if they are concerned about the complete lack of transparency. They gave no credible answers.
Inequality and social injustice lead to anger, despair and violence, the one we saw in the English football fields, during Thatcher’s neoliberal era. In Greece and elsewhere oligarchs are trying to control football, in order to pursue political or economic purposes using an “army” of fans which they get for free when they buy a club.
Against all odds, football still remains the most popular sport and for a reason. Iran can never challenge US supremacy in global affairs, nor can Tonga’s banana production compete with Germanys’ Mercedes. But their football teams can win against the North Americans or the Germans. Football, like religion, is always capable of promising miracles.
At the European Youth Event (EYE) of 2018, which will take place in Strasbourg on 1-2 June, we will discuss corruption in sports very thoroughly and we will debate the subject directly with young people, who deserve to have a better and more promising future.

                The European Commission proposed on Tuesday (17 April) to open EU membership talks with Albania and Macedonia, in line with its new focus on the integration of the Western Balkans.
The renewed interest in the region, which has made some progress in the past year in resolving disputes with neighbours and embraced a more reform-friendly agenda, coincides with concerns about the growing interest of non-EU countries to gain a foothold there, most notably Russia and China.
The proposal came in the Commission’s regular Enlargement Report but it needs to be approved by all 28 member states at the next European Council, and their consent cannot be taken for granted.
Macedonia had already been recommended for opening the talks in 2009 but was vetoed by its EU neighbour Greece. Athens objects to Macedonia’s name, which is the same as that of a northern Greek province. Twenty years of UN-sponsored talks have failed to produce a solution acceptable to both sides.
Macedonia has recently signalled readiness to make concessions and solve the name dispute. It was widely expected that Skopje’s goodwill gestures would be rewarded by an invitation to start accession talks.

Macedonia, is ready to make concessions over its name by adding an extra geographic designation, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev said yesterday (6 February), in a bid to end a long-running row with Greece.


For its part, Albania has been able to mitigate its internal divisions, although some nationalist statements from the country’s leaders have sometimes raised eyebrows among its NATO allies.
Prime Minister Edi Rama said in an emailed statement the enlargement report sends “a strong signal of encouragement to our country and our people, confirming that we are on the right path and setting the scene for the journey of reform that has only just begun”.
“Albania understands that accession is a long-term process that requires prolonged commitment – today’s positive recommendation is only one step in our journey. We very much hope that the member states will support the Commission’s recommendation,” Rama said.
 



US raps Albania's Rama for ‘careless’ words on Kosovo
The United States urged Albania yesterday (21 February) to avoid “careless language” after its prime minister suggested a single president and single security policy for both his country and neighbouring Kosovo in a speech that infuriated Serbia.


Albania and Macedonia are part of the Western Balkan six, together with Montenegro and Serbia, which are already negotiating for membership, and the laggards Kosovo and Bosnia.
“The Commission recommended today that the Council decides that accession negotiations be opened with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania, in light of the progress achieved, maintaining and deepening the current reform momentum,” the Commission statement said
The Commission’s green light came with more strings attached, underscoring the need to strengthen democracy and the rule of law in the region.
“For the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, delivering on the urgent reform priorities will be decisive for the country’s further progress. For Albania, progress will be crucial in the key field in the rule of law, in particular across all five key reform priorities, and continuing to deliver concrete and tangible results,” the Commission statement said.
Montenegro and Serbia, the region’s ‘frontrunners’, are tentatively scheduled to join the bloc in 2025, at the earliest.
Bulgaria, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU Council from January to June, has made reviving Western Balkans’ EU prospects a top priority and will hold a summit with EU and Balkan leaders in Sofia on 17 May.
            ","The European Commission proposed on Tuesday (17 April) to open EU membership talks with Albania and Macedonia, in line with its new focus on the integration of the Western Balkans. The renewed interest in the region, which has made some progress in the past year in resolving disputes with neighbours and embraced a more reform-friendly agenda, coincides with concerns about the growing interest of non-EU countries to gain a foothold there, most notably Russia and China. The proposal came in the Commission’s regular Enlargement Report but it needs to be approved by all 28 member states at the next European Council, and their consent cannot be taken for granted. Macedonia had already been recommended for opening the talks in 2009 but was vetoed by its EU neighbour Greece. Athens objects to Macedonia’s name, which is the same as that of a northern Greek province. Twenty years of UN-sponsored talks have failed to produce a solution acceptable to both sides.

                One year before the European elections, the French president came to Strasbourg to count his allies and convince members of all political groups. However, French ambitions seem to have been revised downward.
Preventing Europe’s divisions while moving forward on several crucial issues was the balancing act that Emmanuel Macron tried in front of the European Parliament in Strasbourg on Tuesday (17 April).
One year before the European elections, the discussion, which lasted nearly three hours, clarified the European priorities of the French president but also the political positions of different actors.
“I do not belong to any political family here,” Macron reiterated, who has refused to tie himself to the centrist group ALDE since he came to power, despite the repeated veiled invitations and an obviously common ideology.
By leaving the door open, Macron is trying to rally to his cause any European politician motivated by EU reform. His calls for the construction of a “new European sovereignty” and “the protection of European citizens” have been met with acclaim.



Friction between France and Germany over En Marche's European ambitions
In the run-up to a European council on the revival of the European project, the increasingly direct political rivalry between En Marche and the CDU make the exchange between France and Germany difficult.


“Macron has also come to count his allies, which seem to be within the centre and centre left of the European political spectrum,” said Sébastien Maillard, director of the Jacques Delors Institute in France.
Democracy first
The speech was set within the context of the recent elections in Hungary and Macron did not hesitate to launch into an ode to democracy and the role of the Parliament, while criticising the temptation of anti-liberalism of Viktor Orbán. The way in which he was reelected has been criticised by the OSCE.
“Confronted with autoritarism, the answer is not an authoritarian democracy but the authority of democracy,” he said.
His criticism was addressed at Orbán but also at the blind support the Hungarian prime minister enjoys from the centre-right European People’s Party (EPP), the largest political group in the European Parliament.
Incidentally, the European right has not warmed up much to the French president, although EPP group leader Manfred Weber reluctantly acknowledged his actions.
Some in the EPP, such as Franck Proust, have criticised the president, while others, such as Swede Anna Maria Corazza Bildt or Frenchman Alain Lamassoure have praised his speech, showing potential cracks in the unity of the Parliament’s biggest group.
Ironically, Macron, who is often considered as a right-winger in France, has received a warmer welcome from the Socialists and the Greens, who asked him direct questions but also thanked him for coming to Strasbourg.
Macron: the ideas man
“Without crazy dreams about enlargement, a lot of you wouldn’t be here today,” Macron insisted, saying he supports improved cohesion policy as one of his long-term projects.
France’s priorities are nonetheless coated in realism: instead of a fast and ambitious eurozone reform, which was his priority during the campaign, the French president is now championing the idea of a digital tax.
Socialist MEP Isabelle Thomas thinks that this is somewhat of a cop-out. “It is all good to progress on own resources, but this is the least advanced tax, and it needs to include fiscal evasion of all companies, not only the digital ones.”
As for the next multiannual financial framework (MFF), Macron showed willingness to increase France’s contribution, without going into the specifics.
He also insisted that cohesion funds must be conditional on respecting democratic principles and violently condemned funding is currently used. “They cannot be used to finance fiscal and social dumping,” he said.
After Brexit, the EU will lose 10% of its budget, unless other sources materialise and cohesion funds are being considered as a sacrificial lamb. “His speeches are always beautiful, it’s an ode to Europe, but we fear that this carriage could turn into a pumpkin, like in France,” MEP Thomas warned.
Among his new ideas, the French president acknowledged the mishandling of refugees in France. He suggested a migration agency that could give money to regions and local authorities to take care of refugees.
“Macron has made an interesting speech, but it was not ambitious enough,” said French MEP Karima Delli (Greens/EFA), who is usually quite close to the president.
If those propositions seem less ambitious than the ones he made in September at his landmark speech at the Sorbonne, they have the merit of being on the table now, and that is enough for many European democrats impressed by the oddity that is Emmanuel Macron.
There is still one important partner that needs convincing though: Angela Merkel, and she is already proving to be the reason why French ambitions have been lowered.

                Turkey is moving rapidly away from the path of European Union membership, the top EU official in charge of negotiations said on Tuesday (17 April), as Brussels delivered its harshest criticism yet of what it sees as Ankara’s shift towards authoritarianism.
While couched in diplomatic language, the European Commission’s annual report on Turkey’s progress towards membership blamed Ankara for a broad, collective and disproportionate crackdown after a failed 2016 coup attempt.

It warned that years of progress towards European Union standards in human rights, freedom of expression and the rule of law were being reversed and that Turkey had seen a weakening of local democracy as presidential powers increased.
Turkey “continues to take huge strides away from the EU, in particular in the areas of rule of law and fundamental rights,” European Commissioner Johannes Hahn, who oversees EU membership bids, told a news conference after publishing the report.

“The Commission has repeatedly called on Turkey to reverse this negative trend as a matter of priority and makes very clear the recommendations on this in today’s report,” he said.
The report says Turkey’s saying recent spats with European states were “not conducive to good neighbourly relations”.

The Turkish foreign ministry hit back at the report, saying the Commission showed “that it was once again unwilling to understand the difficulties of the period we are passing through” and was “far from understanding the realities of Turkey”.
It complained that the Commission was “unable to be objective and balanced.”

The report focused particularly on rows including Ankara’s arrest of two Greek soldiers and its promise to prevent the internationally recognised Greek Cypriot government from exploring for oil and gas.
“Tensions in the Aegean Sea and eastern Mediterranean were not conducive to good neighbourly relations and undermined regional stability and security,” the report said.
“Bilateral relations with several EU member states deteriorated, including at times offensive and unacceptable rhetoric.”
The report added: “Turkey needs to commit itself unequivocally to good neighbourly relations.”
The Turkish foreign ministry however warned the EU against giving a “carte blanche” to its member states such as Greece, saying such a stance “contradicts the EU’s own values”.
‘Membership unchanged target’ 
EU diplomatic chief Federica Mogherini ruled out ending the current freeze on opening new “chapters” in Turkey’s EU membership process.
“Turkey is a candidate country, an important partner for the EU and a key actor, but it is not the time to open a new chapter in the negotiations,” she said.
The Turkish foreign ministry complained that “certain general allegations, accusations and comments targeting Turkey in the report are unacceptable”.
In response, Turkey said it was not being treated fairly or objectively by the EU, and added that despite the report its goal was still to join the bloc.
“Turkey isn’t the one moving away from the European Union. The side that is not objective and is, unfortunately, biased and unfair, is the EU,” Turkish government spokesman Bekir Bozdag said, adding that positive elements in the report did not mask the bloc’s unfairness towards Turkey.
“Despite this, we have not abandoned our European Union goal, and we have no intention to do so going forward,” he said after a cabinet meeting.
Negotiations began in 2005 and so far Turkey has opened just 16 out of 33 chapters.
Relations between Brussels and Ankara have been particularly tense in the wake of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s crackdown following a coup attempt in July 2016.
Erdoğan has drifted increasingly closer to Russia and Iran, especially concerning the conflict in Syria, despite being a NATO member.
Meanwhile, Bozdag said it was up to Greece to avoid “provocative” acts which he warned risked leading to “undesired incidents” in the Aegean Sea.

The report also said that Turkey should lift the state of emergency imposed after the failed coup “without delay.”
“The broad scale and collective nature, and the disproportionality of measures… such as widespread dismissals, arrests, and detentions, continue to raise serious concerns,” it said.
However at the same time as the report was issued, the National Security Council (MGK), after a meeting chaired by Erdoğan, said in a statement it had agreed to recommend the emergency should be extended for three more months. The latest extension was due to come to an end on Thursday.

                The new president of the European Economic and Social Committee, Luca Jahier, intends to promote a new culture of dialogue around sustainable development, culture, peace and youth, in order to bring citizens closer to the European project.
“We are currently witnessing a widespread crisis not only of traditional parties but also of participation in traditional political life,” the new EESC president told EURACTIV on Wednesday (18 April), the day he took up the post in the Commitee, often referred to as ‘the voice of the European civil society’.
“New forms of debate are needed to strengthen participatory democracy and, in turn, bring citizens closer to the European project. And they must be articulated around sustainable development, culture, peace and youth”, he recommends.
Jahier, born in Italy, graduated in political science and went on to become a journalist, political scientist and expert in associative movements. Between 2011 and 2018, he chaired the EESC Group III (“Various Interests”). He supervised a report on the social dimension of the Economic and Monetary Union.
Created in 1957, the EESC is seen as the institutional bridge between the EU and civil society. It was set up to allow all stakeholders to be heard by the Commission, the Council and the Parliament, and to act effectively on the EU’s decision-making.
The Committee’s opinions, adopted by 350 members from three groups (employers, workers and various activities), strongly emphasise its expertise and its link with the real world of employment, in its various components.
Jahier pointed to the 2007 “Grenelle Environment” as an example to follow when seeking dialogue and participatory democracy, and described it as “an extraordinary and unique moment in the history of the European Union”.
Between July and October 2007, the Grenelle Environment brought together representatives of the state, environmental NGOs, social partners and local authorities.
Their working groups defined objectives in a number of areas: biodiversity and natural resources, climate change, relations between the environment and public health, production and consumption patterns, the issue of “environmental governance” or “ecological democracy”, the approach to genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and waste management.
Jahier stressed that the meeting of stakeholders from different backgrounds in different working groups is a “model” of the legislative construction process. “The EESC is an institutional space where men and women from the field put forward their expertise, and we want to ensure that they are well integrated into the European public debate.”
And that brought him to a project involving the EESC and its field expertise in inaugurating these new debate formats: the citizens’ consultations on Europe.
Citizen consultations
Inaugurated on 17 April by French president Emmanuel Macron in Strasbourg, the citizens’ consultations on Europe will take place until October 2018 in 27 member states of the European Union. Marcon first proposed them in a landmark speech in September 2017.
The EESC takes part in this campaign, which aims to gather the proposals of European citizens for a rehaul of the European Union, which Jahier calls ‘rEUnaissance’.
“We have confirmed with [French Minister for European Affairs] Nathalie Loiseau that we will support these consultations within our mission. Though the responsibility of those events remains within the member states,” Jahier said.
While the outlines and proceedings of these consultations have yet to be defined, he welcomed the concept of a dialogue involving European citizens.
“When we put the debate on Europe back at the centre stage, that in itself is already positive. But the very fact that 26 or 28 member states have given their agreement in principle means that this idea has really progressed.”
Institutional capacity
“These new forms of debate are emerging at a time when Europe is surrounded by conflict,” the head of the EESC pointed out.
He cited military conflicts, but also the prospect of a possible trade war. “We are witnessing a period of confrontation and conflict. It’s a time of sudden change that creates a lot of anxiety and puts our social traditions under unprecedented pressure.”
In the face of this upheaval, Europe stands a chance, if it plays its cards right. “Not only is the volume of resources mobilised by Brussels impressive, but Europe also has the institutional capacity to successfully execute the European project,” Jahier concluded.

But the very fact that 26 or 28 member states have given their agreement in principle means that this idea has really progressed.” Institutional capacity “These new forms of debate are emerging at a time when Europe is surrounded by conflict,” the head of the EESC pointed out. He cited military conflicts, but also the prospect of a possible trade war. “We are witnessing a period of confrontation and conflict. It’s a time of sudden change that creates a lot of anxiety and puts our social traditions under unprecedented pressure.” In the face of this upheaval, Europe stands a chance, if it plays its cards right. “Not only is the volume of resources mobilised by Brussels impressive, but Europe also has the institutional capacity to successfully execute the European project,” Jahier concluded.",143

                Is the Selmayr affair closed? That, at least, is how the Commission reads the resolution adopted by the European Parliament today.
The amount of work deployed by the Commission to save Martin Selmayr has been astonishing. The hours of Q&A with journalists, the sleepless nights writing exhaustive answers to questions by MEPs, the time spent by MEPs drafting resolutions and amendments: it has been an epic effort.

Our take is that the Selmayr case is far from over, and the smell it leaves will forever taint the Juncker commission.
In the absence of a spectacular turn of events or journalistic scoops, the scandal will stay on the back burner.

The Roundup
By Alexandra Brzozowski 
Juncker’s former chief-of-staff Martin Selmayr once again proves to be bulletproof. He is set to keep his job despite a warning shot from MEPs who described his appointment “as a coup-like action.” Mysterious Martin, sinister Selmayr?, asks Denis MacShane in a guest blog post.
While the debate on Europe’s future gains momentum, EPP leader Manfred Weber calls on the German Christian Democrats to show more willingness to compromise on Eurozone reforms so Germany could find consensus with France.
The EU will not negotiate anything “under threat”, Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmström has fired back in the looming trade war with the US, ruling out any concession to avoid Trump’s tariffs.
There are mistakes you only make once. The EU is now pushing to approve its trade deal with Japan, hoping to avoid a repeat of the public protests that nearly derailed CETA with Canada and laid kicked an EU-US trade pact into the tall grass.
‘Insufficient’ is how Commission Vice chief Frans Timmermans described recent concessions made by Poland on its rule of law dispute. The Deadline for Warsaw to formulate its full proposal to solve the conflict with Brussels is mid-May.
The Tsarist and KGB mentality doesn’t change with time, says Ukraine’s Ambassador to the EU, Mykola Tochytskyi, explaining in an interview why Kyiv is against the planned Nord Stream 2 pipeline.
To achieve real progress in EU integration, Western Balkan countries need a clearly defined plan that includes a concrete timeframe for all six countries, argues Ilhan Kyuchyuk.
After a truly energetic day in Strasbourg, headlined by French President Emmanuel Macron’s speech, MEPs signed off on a number of energy laws with the EU taking a small step towards finalising the Clean Energy Package.
Without ambitious energy efficiency goals, the EU will fail to reach the targets of the Paris agreement, warn Jan Rosenow and Stefan Scheuer.
Meanwhile, researchers claim that energy use for cooling could jump to 90% due to a burgeoning middle class and a warming world.

                The European Values Instrument can provide a much-needed boost to the weakened resilience of European democracies. However, the details of its structure will determine whether this opportunity will be grasped, write Jan Jakub Chromiec and Katarzyna Pełczyńska-Nałęcz.
Jan Jakub Chromiec and Katarzyna Pełczyńska-Nałęcz both work at the Batory Foundation’s Open Europe Programme, as expert and director respectively. 
The European Union is close to creating an instrument that will enable its citizens to promote democratic values. On March 1, Jean-Claude Juncker and Günther Oettinger recommended the creation of an “EU Values Fund” within the multiannual financial framework for 2021-2027. The Committee on Civil Liberties of the European Parliament proposed a similar “European Values Instrument” in a resolution to be voted on during the plenary today. 
This shows that the Union is beginning to recognise the need for a comprehensive policy of promoting European values. This policy requires more than just disciplinary action, such as triggering Article 7 against Poland. Nor can it be implemented top-down alone, at the level of EU institutions and member state governments. The process of strengthening the Union as a community of values must involve its citizens.
However, the mere establishment of a new financial mechanism will not determine its effectiveness. Much depends on how it is designed.
For the European Values Instrument to be effective, it must meet four conditions: 
First, it should have a clear objective – to focus on those fundamental values (listed in Article 2 of the EU Treaty) that are beyond the reach of existing financial mechanisms. Furthermore, it should prioritize the major challenges facing the EU as a community of values today. Hence, the European Values Instrument should focus on:
Support for citizens’ initiatives promoting the rule of law
Mobilising citizens to promote and embed human rights and civil liberties in the member states
Increasing citizens’ resilience to information manipulation, in particular related to new technologies
Promoting equality before the law (regardless of nationality, gender, age, etc.).
Secondly, the instrument should have an adequate budget, large enough to ensure the effectiveness of its activities while not exceeding the absorption capacity of non-governmental organisations in member states. 
A guiding principle should be established that the Union will spend at least as much on value-promotion within the Community as it does in third countries. On this basis, the budget of the European Values Instrument would approximate €2 billion over the next seven-year budgetary period, which is how much the Union spends on promoting democracy and human rights in non-member countries in the current financial perspective.
Thirdly, the new instrument should have an EU-wide character (and thus be equally accessible to all citizens). At the same time, however, it should target not only the large pan-European NGOs, but also, and perhaps especially, those operating locally in individual countries. It is within the member states where the greatest challenges to democracy are emerging today. This makes the way in which funds are distributed crucially important. Ideally, grants should be distributed by independent operators directly to local organizations. Each operator can be responsible for a specific thematic area. Part of its task would be to promote the instrument and to simplify the application process as much as possible.
Fourthly and finally, support should be diversified. Both small grants for small activities and long-term institutional support for larger organizations are needed. In addition, the instrument should take into account the fact that in poorer countries NGOs often do not have funds for co-financing projects.
The EU’s decision-makers have a strategic opportunity to halt the erosion of European values and renew the Union as a values-based community. The European Values Instrument can provide a much-needed boost to the weakened resilience of European democracies. However, the details of its structure will determine whether this opportunity will be grasped.

                The European Union said on Thursday it could impose further sanctions on Venezuela if it believes democracy is being undermined there, after the South American country’s president called for elections next month that the main opposition has said it will boycott.
EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini said in a statement she regretted the way the authorities under President Nicolas Maduro had called the 20 May presidential elections without a consensus on the “conditions for a credible and inclusive electoral process.”

In response, Venezuela’s foreign ministry said in a statement: “The European Union and its member states show their regrettable subordination to the opinions of the U.S. government.”
Venezuela has tumbled into an economic and social crisis, with millions suffering food and medicine shortages, hyperinflation and growing insecurity, which critics say is the result of the dysfunctional policies of Maduro’s government. The collapse has driven an estimated 3 million people to flee the country.

Julio Borges, president of the Venezuelan parliament, is the only opposition leader who is not imprisoned among those shortlisted for this year’s edition of the Sakharov prize on freedom of thought. EURACTIV’s partner EuroEFE reports.


Maduro, who blames the downturn on an “economic war” led by the opposition and the United States, is seeking re-election in the 20 May vote.
The main opposition coalition is boycotting the vote, and the country’s two most popular opposition leaders have been banned from competing.
“The European Union will monitor closely the electoral process and related developments on the ground and stands ready to react through appropriate measures to any decision or action that might continue to undermine democracy, the rule of law and human rights situation in the country,” Mogherini added.
She said all parties should be allowed to contest fair elections in the country.

                Could you imagine being denied access to a territory vaster than France, Spain and Portugal combined during your next holiday in Europe? This seems completely unthinkable, yet this is what is happening every year for several weeks in Tibet, write Vincent Metten and Antoine Madelin.
Vincent Metten is the EU policy director at the International Campaign for Tibet. Antoine Madelin is International Advocacy Director at FIDH.
Since a wave of protests swept across the world’s highest and largest plateau from March 10, 2008, to be met by violent suppression, the 1.2 million square kilometres of the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) have been closed to foreign tourists every year for at least a month.
This year’s closure started on 10 February and lasted until the beginning of April. And the European Union, which just launched a joint Tourism Year with China, does not seem to be too concerned.
At the opening of the EU-China Summit in July 2016, President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker and Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang announced that 2018 would be the EU-China Tourism Year (ECTY).
China is one of the world’s largest travel markets, both in terms of abroad travel and expenditure, and it seemed only normal that the European Union would seek to engage in initiatives aimed at boosting the flow of Chinese visitors to Europe.
But this decision seems to have been taken in complete disregard of the asymmetry between the EU and China in this domain, highlighted in particular by the issue of access to Tibet.
Outside of the annual closure of Tibet described above, foreign tourists, including EU citizens, indeed still require a number of special authorisations and permits, in addition to their Chinese visa, to visit the TAR.
Access is even more difficult for exiled Tibetans who wish to travel to Tibet to visit their families and friends or to do business. They often face a long and complex application process, as well as strong pressure and even blackmailing from the Chinese consular and diplomatic authorities.
As the European Parliament has noted, these restrictions simply “do not exist for Chinese citizens who are granted visas to travel to EU member states or within the Schengen area”, who enjoy free and open access to the entire territories of the EU member states all year round.
At a time when European leaders are repeatedly urging China for more balance in the trade relationship, this apparent silence regarding the lack of reciprocity in the respect for fundamental rights, including the freedom of movement and the freedom of information of European citizens in China and Tibet, is unsettling.



EU, China bet on tourism to boost trade, ease tensions
At a time of increased tensions between Brussels and Beijing, the two partners met in Venice on Friday (19 January) to launch the EU-China Tourism Year, hoping to patch up or better revitalise relations.


Worse, the European Union seems to have totally overlooked a number of issues relating to the promotion of tourism and the human rights situation in Tibetan areas of China, this in total contravention of its commitment to mainstream human rights and freedoms in all areas of its external policy.
The Chinese government is marketing Tibet as a romantic ‘Shangri La’ destination, using the growing interest in Tibetan Buddhism and culture – both abroad and in mainland China – to attract large numbers of tourists.
At the same time, China is imposing policies in Tibet of unprecedented depth and severity, leading to grave fears for the survival of Tibetan cultural identity.
While Chinese tourists are welcomed to Tibet and to Europe at all times, there are increasing restrictions on Tibetans’ freedom to travel both in Tibet and abroad. The Chinese authorities often deny and recall their passports in total contravention of Chinese law, and even block them from going on pilgrimage to the Dalai Lama’s teachings in India.
Tibetans are also excluded from the planning and development of tourism policies, and Chinese guides trained by the Party-state are prioritised over Tibetans. The increasing presence of international hotel chains in Lhasa and other parts of Tibet – which provides support for Beijing’s propaganda claims of stability and ‘harmony’ in Tibet – raises further concern about the impact of untrammelled tourism on the Tibetan plateau’s fragile landscape.
As the number of self-immolations in Tibet since 2009 has now reached 153, indicating the Tibetan people’s continued anguish at Chinese oppression, it is time for the European Union and its member states to take stock and find ways to rebalance their relationship, based on the fundamental values of the EU (the respect for democracy and human rights) rather than on the authoritarian principles of the Chinese regime.
In the US, members of Congress have introduced bipartisan, bicameral legislation, the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act, to promote an open and accessible Tibet both for American citizens and for Tibetans themselves, including the Dalai Lama.
The EU could follow this initiative and extend the notion of reciprocity – which is largely promoted by the EU in the areas of trade and economic relations – to the respect for fundamental rights, including freedom of movement and access to Tibet.
If such principles were applied, the 2018 EU-China Tourism Year could even represent an opportunity for Tibet – an opportunity to push for the engagement of Tibetans in tourism, and free access at all times for European tourists to this remarkable high plateau landscape, the Roof of the World.

If such principles were applied, the 2018 EU-China Tourism Year could even represent an opportunity for Tibet – an opportunity to push for the engagement of Tibetans in tourism, and free access at all times for European tourists to this remarkable high plateau landscape, the Roof of the World.",147

                The European Commission surprised tech policy observers this week when it suggested to amp up transatlantic cooperation on cybersecurity, just as Europe’s relations with the US are under strain following the Facebook data leakage scandal.
Andrus Ansip, the European Commission Vice President in charge of the EU’s digital policies, has called for a new “secure transatlantic cyber area” with the US.
He said at a Silicon Valley conference late on Wednesday (18 April) that the EU and US should also agree on the same cybersecurity standards to apply to internet-connected devices.
Ansip’s call for stepped up cooperation with the US came as American lawmakers and tech companies grapple with last month’s revelations that millions of Facebook users’ data was mishandled, and start to pay closer attention to the EU’s new data protection law, known as the GDPR, that will take effect on 25 May.
During a hearing in the US Congress last week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg offered praise for the legislation, which includes strict privacy rules and steep fines if companies misbehave.



After Facebook scandal, MEPs argue the GDPR isn’t enough
The EU needs more legal safeguards to prevent massive privacy breaches like the current scandal over Facebook and British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, MEPs from different political parties argued on Wednesday (18 April).


Common cybersecurity standards
The scandal surrounding Facebook and political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which harvested data from the social media platform, has helped EU politicians argue the law is needed to control companies that collect users’ personal information.
Since reports of the incident broke in March, European regulators have appeared confident about the bloc’s approach to regulating technology companies.
Ansip’s call for closer cooperation on cybersecurity was unexpected in Brussels: it’s a sensitive area where regulators often hesitate to work with their counterparts from different countries. But the recent surge in Russian cybersecurity attacks targeting the US and Europe should change the way reluctant lawmakers think, Ansip suggested.
“In Europe, as in the United States, we remain on the frontlines of these assaults on democracy, threatening to undermine institutions,” he said.
It was Ansip’s proposal to come up with common cybersecurity standards that apply in the EU and the US that raised eyebrows in Brussels.
Negotiations over a draft EU cybersecurity bill are simmering, and national governments and MEPs are still in early negotiations over a Commission proposal to create a cybersecurity certification system for internet-connected products that are sold in the EU. Talks won’t be easy, and some member states have expressed wariness that the plan could be an overstep into their national systems to approve product security.



Commission should 'walk the walk' on cybersecurity, German chief says
The European Commission should “walk the walk” and use strong encryption to protect its computer networks against hackers—instead of pushing member states to adopt controversial new legislation, the head of Germany’s cybersecurity agency has said.


But Ansip sounded confident in Silicon Valley. He described the draft EU legislation as “a good basis to discuss and make sure that our cyber standards are aligned on both sides of the Atlantic”.
“If both sides could agree on common security standards for the IoT [internet of things], this would set a global standard. Exchanging detailed information about cyber incidents will help to prevent future attacks,” the former Estonian prime minister told conference attendees.
Since EU-level discussions could still drag on for several months or longer, any broader agreement on cybersecurity rules with the US would likely take years.
Early reactions positive
But early reactions to Ansip’s suggestions have been positive. Some observers of the bloc’s tech policies said such an agreement on cybersecurity standards would be a way of promoting the EU’s technology rules to other countries.
Dutch Liberal MEP Marietje Schaake said that despite clear “tensions and concerns” clouding transatlantic relations since President Trump took office in 2017, the EU and US should cooperate more on digital security.
“While attacks on the EU and on fundamental rights need to be challenged, the US is more than the White House, and we see a new appreciation for the European approach to regulation of the digital world in the public interest,” she said.
Schaake described the EU’s comparatively tough regulation on several technology issues as evidence that the bloc is “setting norms that would ideally be transatlantic and even global norms”.



EU cybersecurity boss eyes hardware as early target for certification plans
A draft bill to set up an EU system certifying the cybersecurity level of tech products is still trapped up in negotiations after the European Commission announced the overhaul last September.


For some cybersecurity researchers, any future agreement with the US on standards would be a practical way to pressure companies to create secure products.
“The fact that Ansip talks about this is sort of a big deal,” said Jan-Peter Kleinhans, who researches cybersecurity and the internet of things at the Berlin-based think tank Stiftung Neue Verantwortung.
Kleinhans said it is unlikely the EU could set a global standard once its cybersecurity certification system is in place, similar to how some countries outside the bloc have drawn from the GDPR to draft their own tougher data protection laws.
“With IT security, it’s different because these devices are manufactured in Asia, especially consumer devices, and it only works if we make the case to companies why they should pay attention to European standards,” he said.
Companies are more likely to comply with standards that are the same for two large markets, the EU and the US, because chances are higher that oversight bodies would catch them if they do not uphold security rules, according to Kleinhans.
He predicted that sealing an agreement with the US on cybersecurity standards might be easy for low-level consumer items like internet routers and webcams because those discussions would be technical, and not necessarily fraught with disagreement over politically charged issues like privacy.
There has been a recent uptick in cybersecurity attacks targeting inexpensive household products with weak security features. The US and UK governments warned earlier this week that Russian hackers had preyed on home internet routers.
For some big technology companies, Ansip’s proposal to develop common standards with the US is a sign that the EU rules might not disrupt their business. Some firms have been concerned the legislation might set cybersecurity criteria that are much tougher than other countries’ systems.
DigitalEurope, a Brussels-based association that represents companies including Google and Microsoft, criticised the Commission’s original proposal to create an EU certification system last year, arguing that higher standards in Europe might create a trade barrier with countries outside the bloc.
Iva Tasheva, DigitalEurope’s cybersecurity policy manager, said on Thursday that the EU system should “be compatible with existing international mutual recognition mechanisms”. International mechanisms could include systems outlining common criteria to test product safety.



EU cybersecurity chief: Now is the time to discuss liability
There needs to be more discussion about liability for cybersecurity attacks, Steve Purser, director of operators at the EU cybersecurity agency ENISA, told EURACTIV.com in an interview.

"155","Ambassador: Turkey, EU should cooperate in safely returning Syrian refugees home","Interview","Global Europe","20-04-2018","At the Varna summit, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan told his interlocutors that the EU should cooperate in Syria in terms of helping Syrian refugees to go back to their homes, Turkish ambassador to the EU Faruk Kaymakcı told EURACTIV in an exclusive interview.","https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/interview/turkish-ambassador-eu-should-cooperate-in-bringing-syrian-refugees-to-afrin/","By Sarantis Michalopoulos | EURACTIV.com 20-04-2018","
                “Our intention to go to Afrin is to clear this area from PYD-YPG and Daesh. We want to make these areas stable and secure so that Afrin people, who are already in Turkey [350,000], can go back to their homes,” Turkey’s ambassador to the EU, Faruk Kaymakcı, told EURACTIV in an exclusive interview.
He also said the European Commission was unfair to Turkey in its latest progress report by favouring the Balkan candidates, ignoring Turkey’s difficulties and failing to provide a clearer accession perspective for Ankara.
Faruk Kaymakcı is the Permanent Delegate Ambassador of the Republic of Turkey to the European Union. 
He spoke to EURACTIV’s Sarantis Michalopoulos. 
Here are the interview highlights:
Until delimitation of the Cyprus exclusive economic zone between Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots is achieved, hydrocarbon activities are not possible;
Greece is provoking Turkey by claiming ownership of islets and rock formations in the Aegean Sea
Commission’s progress report is unfair, it should have given a clearer accession perspective to Turkey;
US supports PYD-YPG although they know it’s a Syrian branch of PKK; Turkey has been abandoned by some NATO allies in Iraq and Syria;
EU should stop politicising issue of two Greek soldiers and leave it to the court to decide;
FETÖ are trying to lobby everywhere, including in the European Parliament, EU is only starting to understand their true nature;
Turkey has no eye on Afrin after it has been cleared of PYD- YPG and Daesh and stabilised, the region will be left to its local owners.
The European Commission published its progress report on Turkey this week and pointed out a number of shortcomings. Why doesn’t the Commission see progress in democratic reforms? 
As you might already know, now we call them country reports. These reports, of course, analyse the candidate countries in the face of the EU acquis. It is natural that there are some shortcomings and some progress in different areas. Unfortunately, the period the report is referring to is one of the most difficult in Turkey’s history. We had the 15 July FETÖ coup attempt, which threatened Turkey’s democracy, institutions and as a result, we had to declare a state of emergency and take some extraordinary measures. [FETÖ is a name the Turkish government use for an alleged Gülenist terrorist group.] At the same time, Turkey is fighting three notorious organisations, such as Daesh, PKK, PYD-YPG, as well as FETÖ terrorist organisation. When you fight three terrorist organisations, you cannot do everything normally. This is also what happened in France after the terrorist attacks. Of course, I don’t underestimate these attacks, but imagine the situation in Turkey, which has to deal with a PKK  terrorist organisation that claimed more than 40,000 lives. Daesh destroyed some parts of two countries, Syria and Iraq, and FETÖ caused 250 deaths and more than 200 people were injured overnight.



Hahn: Turkey taking ‘huge strides’ away from EU
Turkey is moving rapidly away from the path of European Union membership, the top EU official in charge of negotiations said on Tuesday (17 April), as Brussels delivered its harshest criticism yet of what it sees as Ankara’s shift towards authoritarianism.


Also, Turkey is hosting more than 4 million people, mostly from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Bangladesh etc. We have spent more than €30 billion so far.
On the other hand, we see in Europe the rise of the far-right, populism and scapegoating of Turkey is some of the national elections.
The report refers to some shortcomings in different fields but also to some good cooperation and progress in other fields and accession chapters.
Nevertheless, the report has some problems. One is that it makes a differentiation between  the Western Balkans and Turkey. Actually, there is no description of Western Balkans. What is the southern Balkans, what is the northern Balkans? There is no such a definition. If you talk about candidate countries, there are only five and there are two potential candidates. One of them is not even recognised by all the EU member states. [Kosovo is not recognised by Greece, Cyprus, Spain, Romania and Slovakia.]
The second thing is that the problems that Turkey faces have not been sufficiently understood by the EU side. Because the Fethullahist Terrorist Organisation or FETÖ is a major threat to Turkey, and the PYD/YPG, PKK’s Syrian branch has attacked Turkey more than 700 times. These should be understood clearly. We also have to take into account the conflicts around Turkey.
The report should also give a clearer perspective of accession. If the EU is not acting as a real anchor, EU cannot expect any of the candidate countries to be a credible candidate. This is the dilemma of the EU. Why is this given clearly to those six countries in the Balkans and not clearly given to Turkey, although Turkey is also a negotiating candidate? The more EU will become an anchor, the more willing and faster Turkey will become in terms of reforms and aligning itself with the EU acquis.
Another unfair part of the report is related to bilateral relations. Of course, we need to have normal relations with each member state, this is natural. But using this report or an EU institution as a leverage tool against a candidate country in the name of EU membership solidarity regardless whether the concerned member state is right or wrong is not helping. I mean Greece and the Greek-Cypriot Administration.
This is creating more tension and it makes the problem more complicated.
Talking about Greece, there has been an escalation in the rhetoric and incidents in the Aegean Sea.



EU warns Turkey over Cyprus ship incident
The European Union on Monday (13 February) called on Turkey to avoid threats and “refrain from any actions that might damage good neighbourly” ties after Cyprus accused the Turkish military of obstructing a ship exploring for gas.


Why do we have these incidents?
This is what I am asking.
Because they are caused by our Greek-Cypriot and Greek neighbours. Of course, some try to portray Turkey as an aggressive country but what is the point of putting flowers on a rock, on a small islet in the Aegean Sea? Why do we need that? What is the point of putting a Greek flag on an island where there is no one? And what is the point of flying over these small islets and rocks, which are not even inhabited? These actions will not satisfy any claim of sovereignty but just cause provocations.
Greece says this is its territory.
Turkey says the same. So how can you claim that this is your sovereignty? It might be Turkish or Greek, but the delimitation has not been made between Greece and Turkey. Until the delimitation is agreed by the interested parties, no one can claim any territory or territorial waters in disputed areas. What we are saying is that these islets, whose status is not defined by international or bilateral agreements, cannot be claimed by any side. So until we solve these problems why are we provoking all these things?
Flowers, flags or even picnics on these islets are provocations and we don’t want these, especially after the visit of President Erdogan to Greece after 65 years. And why are these happening now? Let’s hope that these provocations will stop and I think these islets and rocks will become an area of cooperation and not a source of conflict.



EU warns Turkey after it violates Greek airspace 141 times in one day
Turkish aeroplanes and helicopters illegally entered Greece’s airspace 141 times yesterday (15 May), the Hellenic National Defence General Staff reported.


In terms of the Greek-Cypriot administration and the hydrocarbon activities around the island of Cyprus, they can do whatever they like in their own exclusive economic zone. But again, the delimitation is not done, so there are issues between the Greek Cypriot Administration and Turkey, as well as with Turkish-Cypriots.
They claim some areas belong to them although the delimitation is not done yet. There are also areas, which are under the sovereignty of Turkish-Cypriots. Until the Greek-Cypriots agree with the Turkish Cypriots in these areas, Greek Cypriots cannot do anything.
Five years ago, within the UN system, Turkey and Turkish Cypriots proposed that we should create a joint committee on hydrocarbon activities and this committee should decide together until there is a final solution to the Cyprus issue. The income generated out of these drills would be distributed to the people of the island. But the Greek-Cypriot side rejected this and now they are offering some lucrative incentives to some companies and they come to explore oil and gas. This is a problem.
So, you are saying that you will block these drillings.
Turkey will not allow any illegal activity in its exclusive economic zone. The same thing applies for the Turkish-Cypriots. We will stand by them.
The US has warned Turkey with sanctions if it purchases the Russian S-400 missile system. Do you believe this purchase is in line with the NATO commitments?
It’s not a question of being in line. The question is that we have been abandoned by some of our NATO allies. When we needed NATO at our most difficult times, some of our NATO allies did not support us. I am referring to the war in Syria and the developments in Iraq.
Missiles and rockets have been fired at us from Syria and we needed the air-defense capability and we asked our NATO allies to support us. Some of them did it, but unfortunately, the US did not support us and we had to take care of our own air defense. Actually, we first went to our NATO allies, but the US said no. Then we went to China and as a last resort, we tried Russia. We were forced by our allies to find an alternative. The border we are protecting is not only Turkey’s border, but it’s Europe’s and NATO’s border. Unfortunately, our allies do not realize how important this is.
The Greek Cypriots wanted to buy the S-300 missiles and put them on the island of Cyprus. Don’t forget that Greece has already these S-300 missiles. Are they compatible with NATO? You should also check with them.
Do you feel that Russia, politically and diplomatically speaking, is currently closer to your interests than Europe and the US?
Turkey is a member of the West and Europe. For the time being, unfortunately, our allies in the West are not trying to understand and support us sufficiently. We have to protect our own interest and we also have to be realistic: whether we like it or not, Russia and Iran are important actors in Syria. Iran is an important actor in Iraq and you have to work with them. We cannot work with our own allies in Syria while the US is supporting PYD-YPG, although they know it’s a Syrian branch of PKK, something the former US Defence Secretary and the CIA fact-book officially recognise. What do you expect us to do?
What are the plans for Afrin? Do you plan to remain there for a long time?
Turkey has no eye on another country’s, territory. I can clearly say that our intention to go to Afrin is to clear this area from PYD-YPG and Daesh. We want to make these areas stable and secure so that Afrin people, who are already in Turkey [350,000], can go back to their homes. Turkey is planning to give the control of these areas to the local owners. We have no intention to rule others’ countries.
Did you discuss this with the EU partners at the recent Varna summit?



Varna to become permanent venue for EU-Turkey talks
The Varna summit held on Monday (26 March) between EU institution leaders and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan failed to yield any notable outcomes. But Bulgaria’s PM said the port city could become a permanent venue for future talks.


President Erdoğan explained the aims of the Operation Olive Branch in Afrin and we told the EU side that Turkey and the EU should also cooperate in Syria in terms of helping Syrians to go back to their homes, but of course, when the conditions are appropriate and when they wish to go.
Does Turkey count on the EU financial support, the second €3 billion tranche to transfer these Syrians back to their homes?
First, the EU should approve the second €3 billion. Out of the first €3 billion, despite being entirely contracted, only €1.9 billion has been spent. EU and Turkey are discussing how the second €3 billion tranche could be spent in the most efficient way for Syrians.
The European Parliament and the EU Council have urged Turkey to release the two Greek soldiers. EPP’s Manfred Weber even called these people “political prisoners” that Ankara is using – also the German journalists- to put pressure on the EU on other issues. Will you return these people?
We have to respect the rule of law in Turkey and the decision of the court. There is a violation of the border, willingly or unwillingly, by these two soldiers with military functions. The court is dealing with this issue, full stop. We should wait for the court decision. But if the EU continues to politicise the issue, it would be wrong. Leave justice to the court. Full stop.
Yes, okay, but for more than one month now we still don’t know the charges. 
I’m not aware of every single detail of the court case, but leave it to the court. As I told you, Turkey is getting through difficult times, after the 15 July FETÖ coup attempt many cases have taken more time than we expected, not only about these two soldiers. We have been also criticised for some other cases where the charges against suspects were not made as quickly as it should have been made.
But again, the more the EU politicizes, the more tensions are created and this is not the right way. It’s a big loss in term of EU’s credibility to get involve itself in a judicial case. It’s wrong for any institution to get involved in a judicial case.
So, this is not connected with the 8 Turkish soldiers who fled to Greece?



Greek court says Turkish soldiers should not be extradited
The Greek Supreme Court ruled today (26 January) that eight soldiers who fled to Greece after a failed coup attempt in Turkey should not be extradited to Ankara.


I said what I wanted to say above.
Who fought in Afrin? Some press reports suggested that in the ranks of the Free Syrian Army there were former fighters of ISIS or Al-Qaeda.
This is totally wrong. We trained the Free Syrian Army together with some of our NATO allies in Turkey. So we know who the Free Syrian Army is, who Al-Qaeda or Daesh is. This is a campaign to discredit the Afrin operation. We have seen much fake news regarding the Afrin operation.
(He shows pictures of the Afrin operation, of what he says is connection of PKK and PYD/YPG, and repeats: “Weapons are given free of charge to PYD/YPG by our ally, the US.”)
Mr Erdoğan has said Turkey will chase Gülenists wherever they are. There were also reports suggesting kidnapping people in Kosovo.



Erdogan vows to bring back Gülenists from abroad
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday (9 April) his country is determined to continue the fight against what he calls the terrorist movement of Fethullah Gülen and bring home all “traitors” from abroad. 


Turkey has a rule of law and chasing and kidnapping are not the right words. Turkey is asking all those countries, where FETO terrorists or criminals are, to extradite them. Turkey is a state…
Yes, but happened in Kosovo?
We asked the Kosovo authorities to extradite them, that’s it.
So, this was in cooperation with the Kosovo government.
Of course, with Kosovo authorities.
Do you trust the EU governments to help you with this?
I think the EU has started understanding better what the FETÖ members really are. Some of our EU colleagues thought that FETÖ is a charity organisation. Now they realise that FETÖ has turned into a criminal network and even a terrorist organisation which attempted a coup against the government and democracy. Even in the Commission report on Turkey, there are references to FETÖ as well as PYD-YPG terrorist organizations in the section about counter-terrorism.



Erdogan vows to bring back Gülenists from abroad
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday (9 April) his country is determined to continue the fight against what he calls the terrorist movement of Fethullah Gülen and bring home all “traitors” from abroad. 


The Commission report also emphasised that you have prolonged the state of emergency period too long.
Yes, the Government sees it necessary and the prolongation is a decision of the government. We lost 250 people overnight due to FETÖ and 2,000 have been seriously injured. Not to mention all damages to our several institutions and system.
FETÖ is not a simple network but an investment for over 40 years now. They have been infiltrating everywhere, in different ministries, police, judiciary and politics as well.
Do you believe there is external support from other countries to these people?
Yes of course, they can still operate in Brussels, in the US and in some countries under the disguise of schools, think tanks, newspapers etc.
So you are saying that there are in Brussels too.
Yes, in the European Parliament, they are trying to lobby, it’s also the same thing in the US and London. There are 5 categories: plotters, criminals, immorals, forced people or those who did not know how they got involved as well as the innocent believers. It’s not easy to make a distinction among the five. Inquiry Commission and Ministerial Boards are meticulously working on individual cases.
When we asked to extradite some of them, some countries said they were not really criminals or were not involved in the coup directly and they hesitate. Even with the companies that they have, they are financing this FETÖ network. The problem is that some countries look at these people like NGOs or journalists.

Hahn: Turkey taking ‘huge strides’ away from EU Turkey is moving rapidly away from the path of European Union membership, the top EU official in charge of negotiations said on Tuesday (17 April), as Brussels delivered its harshest criticism yet of what it sees as Ankara’s shift towards authoritarianism. Also, Turkey is hosting more than 4 million people, mostly from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Bangladesh etc. We have spent more than €30 billion so far. On the other hand, we see in Europe the rise of the far-right, populism and scapegoating of Turkey is some of the national elections. The report refers to some shortcomings in different fields but also to some good cooperation and progress in other fields and accession chapters. Nevertheless, the report has some problems. One is that it makes a differentiation between the Western Balkans and Turkey. Actually, there is no description of Western Balkans. What is the southern Balkans, what is the northern Balkans? There is no such a definition. If you talk about candidate countries, there are only five and there are two potential candidates. One of them is not even recognised by all the EU member states. [Kosovo is not recognised by Greece, Cyprus, Spain, Romania and Slovakia.] The second thing is that the problems that Turkey faces have not been sufficiently understood by the EU side. Because the Fethullahist Terrorist Organisation or FETÖ is a major threat to Turkey, and the PYD/YPG, PKK’s Syrian branch has attacked Turkey more than 700 times. These should be understood clearly. We also have to take into account the conflicts around Turkey. The report should also give a clearer perspective of accession. If the EU is not acting as a real anchor, EU cannot expect any of the candidate countries to be a credible candidate. This is the dilemma of the EU. Why is this given clearly to those six countries in the Balkans and not clearly given to Turkey, although Turkey is also a negotiating candidate? The more EU will become an anchor, the more willing and faster Turkey will become in terms of reforms and aligning itself with the EU acquis. Another unfair part of the report is related to bilateral relations. Of course, we need to have normal relations with each member state, this is natural. But using this report or an EU institution as a leverage tool against a candidate country in the name of EU membership solidarity regardless whether the concerned member state is right or wrong is not helping. I mean Greece and the Greek-Cypriot Administration. This is creating more tension and it makes the problem more complicated. Talking about Greece, there has been an escalation in the rhetoric and incidents in the Aegean Sea. EU warns Turkey over Cyprus ship incident The European Union on Monday (13 February) called on Turkey to avoid threats and “refrain from any actions that might damage good neighbourly” ties after Cyprus accused the Turkish military of obstructing a ship exploring for gas. Why do we have these incidents? This is what I am asking. Because they are caused by our Greek-Cypriot and Greek neighbours. Of course, some try to portray Turkey as an aggressive country but what is the point of putting flowers on a rock, on a small islet in the Aegean Sea? Why do we need that? What is the point of putting a Greek flag on an island where there is no one? And what is the point of flying over these small islets and rocks, which are not even inhabited? These actions will not satisfy any claim of sovereignty but just cause provocations. Greece says this is its territory. Turkey says the same. So how can you claim that this is your sovereignty? It might be Turkish or Greek, but the delimitation has not been made between Greece and Turkey. Until the delimitation is agreed by the interested parties, no one can claim any territory or territorial waters in disputed areas. What we are saying is that these islets, whose status is not defined by international or bilateral agreements, cannot be claimed by any side. So until we solve these problems why are we provoking all these things? Flowers, flags or even picnics on these islets are provocations and we don’t want these, especially after the visit of President Erdogan to Greece after 65 years. And why are these happening now? Let’s hope that these provocations will stop and I think these islets and rocks will become an area of cooperation and not a source of conflict. EU warns Turkey after it violates Greek airspace 141 times in one day Turkish aeroplanes and helicopters illegally entered Greece’s airspace 141 times yesterday (15 May), the Hellenic National Defence General Staff reported. In terms of the Greek-Cypriot administration and the hydrocarbon activities around the island of Cyprus, they can do whatever they like in their own exclusive economic zone. But again, the delimitation is not done, so there are issues between the Greek Cypriot Administration and Turkey, as well as with Turkish-Cypriots. They claim some areas belong to them although the delimitation is not done yet. There are also areas, which are under the sovereignty of Turkish-Cypriots. Until the Greek-Cypriots agree with the Turkish Cypriots in these areas, Greek Cypriots cannot do anything. Five years ago, within the UN system, Turkey and Turkish Cypriots proposed that we should create a joint committee on hydrocarbon activities and this committee should decide together until there is a final solution to the Cyprus issue. The income generated out of these drills would be distributed to the people of the island. But the Greek-Cypriot side rejected this and now they are offering some lucrative incentives to some companies and they come to explore oil and gas. This is a problem. So, you are saying that you will block these drillings. Turkey will not allow any illegal activity in its exclusive economic zone. The same thing applies for the Turkish-Cypriots. We will stand by them. The US has warned Turkey with sanctions if it purchases the Russian S-400 missile system. Do you believe this purchase is in line with the NATO commitments? It’s not a question of being in line. The question is that we have been abandoned by some of our NATO allies. When we needed NATO at our most difficult times, some of our NATO allies did not support us. I am referring to the war in Syria and the developments in Iraq. Missiles and rockets have been fired at us from Syria and we needed the air-defense capability and we asked our NATO allies to support us. Some of them did it, but unfortunately, the US did not support us and we had to take care of our own air defense. Actually, we first went to our NATO allies, but the US said no. Then we went to China and as a last resort, we tried Russia. We were forced by our allies to find an alternative. The border we are protecting is not only Turkey’s border, but it’s Europe’s and NATO’s border. Unfortunately, our allies do not realize how important this is. The Greek Cypriots wanted to buy the S-300 missiles and put them on the island of Cyprus. Don’t forget that Greece has already these S-300 missiles. Are they compatible with NATO? You should also check with them. Do you feel that Russia, politically and diplomatically speaking, is currently closer to your interests than Europe and the US? Turkey is a member of the West and Europe. For the time being, unfortunately, our allies in the West are not trying to understand and support us sufficiently. We have to protect our own interest and we also have to be realistic: whether we like it or not, Russia and Iran are important actors in Syria. Iran is an important actor in Iraq and you have to work with them. We cannot work with our own allies in Syria while the US is supporting PYD-YPG, although they know it’s a Syrian branch of PKK, something the former US Defence Secretary and the CIA fact-book officially recognise. What do you expect us to do? What are the plans for Afrin? Do you plan to remain there for a long time? Turkey has no eye on another country’s, territory. I can clearly say that our intention to go to Afrin is to clear this area from PYD-YPG and Daesh. We want to make these areas stable and secure so that Afrin people, who are already in Turkey [350,000], can go back to their homes. Turkey is planning to give the control of these areas to the local owners. We have no intention to rule others’ countries. Did you discuss this with the EU partners at the recent Varna summit? Varna to become permanent venue for EU-Turkey talks The Varna summit held on Monday (26 March) between EU institution leaders and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan failed to yield any notable outcomes. But Bulgaria’s PM said the port city could become a permanent venue for future talks. President Erdoğan explained the aims of the Operation Olive Branch in Afrin and we told the EU side that Turkey and the EU should also cooperate in Syria in terms of helping Syrians to go back to their homes, but of course, when the conditions are appropriate and when they wish to go. Does Turkey count on the EU financial support, the second €3 billion tranche to transfer these Syrians back to their homes? First, the EU should approve the second €3 billion. Out of the first €3 billion, despite being entirely contracted, only €1.9 billion has been spent. EU and Turkey are discussing how the second €3 billion tranche could be spent in the most efficient way for Syrians. The European Parliament and the EU Council have urged Turkey to release the two Greek soldiers. EPP’s Manfred Weber even called these people “political prisoners” that Ankara is using – also the German journalists- to put pressure on the EU on other issues. Will you return these people? We have to respect the rule of law in Turkey and the decision of the court. There is a violation of the border, willingly or unwillingly, by these two soldiers with military functions. The court is dealing with this issue, full stop. We should wait for the court decision. But if the EU continues to politicise the issue, it would be wrong. Leave justice to the court. Full stop. Yes, okay, but for more than one month now we still don’t know the charges. I’m not aware of every single detail of the court case, but leave it to the court. As I told you, Turkey is getting through difficult times, after the 15 July FETÖ coup attempt many cases have taken more time than we expected, not only about these two soldiers. We have been also criticised for some other cases where the charges against suspects were not made as quickly as it should have been made. But again, the more the EU politicizes, the more tensions are created and this is not the right way. It’s a big loss in term of EU’s credibility to get involve itself in a judicial case. It’s wrong for any institution to get involved in a judicial case. So, this is not connected with the 8 Turkish soldiers who fled to Greece? Greek court says Turkish soldiers should not be extradited The Greek Supreme Court ruled today (26 January) that eight soldiers who fled to Greece after a failed coup attempt in Turkey should not be extradited to Ankara. I said what I wanted to say above. Who fought in Afrin? Some press reports suggested that in the ranks of the Free Syrian Army there were former fighters of ISIS or Al-Qaeda. This is totally wrong. We trained the Free Syrian Army together with some of our NATO allies in Turkey. So we know who the Free Syrian Army is, who Al-Qaeda or Daesh is. This is a campaign to discredit the Afrin operation. We have seen much fake news regarding the Afrin operation. (He shows pictures of the Afrin operation, of what he says is connection of PKK and PYD/YPG, and repeats: “Weapons are given free of charge to PYD/YPG by our ally, the US.”) Mr Erdoğan has said Turkey will chase Gülenists wherever they are. There were also reports suggesting kidnapping people in Kosovo. Erdogan vows to bring back Gülenists from abroad Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday (9 April) his country is determined to continue the fight against what he calls the terrorist movement of Fethullah Gülen and bring home all “traitors” from abroad. Turkey has a rule of law and chasing and kidnapping are not the right words. Turkey is asking all those countries, where FETO terrorists or criminals are, to extradite them. Turkey is a state… Yes, but happened in Kosovo? We asked the Kosovo authorities to extradite them, that’s it. So, this was in cooperation with the Kosovo government. Of course, with Kosovo authorities. Do you trust the EU governments to help you with this? I think the EU has started understanding better what the FETÖ members really are. Some of our EU colleagues thought that FETÖ is a charity organisation. Now they realise that FETÖ has turned into a criminal network and even a terrorist organisation which attempted a coup against the government and democracy. Even in the Commission report on Turkey, there are references to FETÖ as well as PYD-YPG terrorist organizations in the section about counter-terrorism. Erdogan vows to bring back Gülenists from abroad Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday (9 April) his country is determined to continue the fight against what he calls the terrorist movement of Fethullah Gülen and bring home all “traitors” from abroad. The Commission report also emphasised that you have prolonged the state of emergency period too long. Yes, the Government sees it necessary and the prolongation is a decision of the government. We lost 250 people overnight due to FETÖ and 2,000 have been seriously injured. Not to mention all damages to our several institutions and system. FETÖ is not a simple network but an investment for over 40 years now. They have been infiltrating everywhere, in different ministries, police, judiciary and politics as well. Do you believe there is external support from other countries to these people? Yes of course, they can still operate in Brussels, in the US and in some countries under the disguise of schools, think tanks, newspapers etc. So you are saying that there are in Brussels too. Yes, in the European Parliament, they are trying to lobby, it’s also the same thing in the US and London. There are 5 categories: plotters, criminals, immorals, forced people or those who did not know how they got involved as well as the innocent believers. It’s not easy to make a distinction among the five. Inquiry Commission and Ministerial Boards are meticulously working on individual cases. When we asked to extradite some of them, some countries said they were not really criminals or were not involved in the coup directly and they hesitate. Even with the companies that they have, they are financing this FETÖ network. The problem is that some countries look at these people like NGOs or journalists.

                Tens of thousands of Hungarians protested on Saturday (21 April) against government control over the media, which they say helped Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to a landslide election victory earlier this month.
The rally in Budapest was the second mass protest against Orbán since the April 8 election, with demonstrators urging the fragmented opposition parties to join forces against the rightwing nationalist Fidesz party, which won two-thirds of parliamentary seats at the polls.
Since 2010, the Hungarian premier has increased his control over the media and put allies in charge of formerly independent institutions, while his stand on refusing to accept large numbers of migrants in Hungary has also brought him into conflict with the European Union.



Orbán’s triumph sends shockwaves through Europe
Hungary’s anti-immigration Prime Minister Viktor Orbán basked Monday (9 April) in a bulldozer election triumph that delighted other nationalists but sent a chill through civil society groups and portended fresh battles with Brussels.


As tens of thousands of protesters waved flags at the foot of Elizabeth Bridge spanning the Danube, speakers called for freedom of the media and a change in government.
Peter Marki-Zay, who beat the Fidesz candidate in a mayoral by-election in February, urged opposition parties on the right and left to build an alliance and put aside their former bickering.
“History has proved that no oppressive regime lasts forever,” he said.
“We shall fight … against their media dominance and factories of lies.”
“It is fear that holds this system together, and if from tomorrow people no longer have their fears this system will fall.”
In a Facebook post before the rally, organisers said state media has been turned into Orban’s “propaganda machine”.
“Our main goal is to dismantle Fidesz control over the public media … but opposition parties also have a task as they are also responsible for this situation we are in,” they said.
Protesters gathered at the parliament building and then walked to the bridge, waving national and EU flags. Last Saturday, tens of thousands had protested at parliament against what they see as an unfair election system.
Protesters held banners with slogans such as “Viktor give us back democracy”, “We want freedom of the press” and “Regime change”.



MEPs demand triggering Article 7 against Hungary
MEPs are demanding the launch of an infringement procedure against Hungary for breaching ‘core EU values’, just days after Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s sweeping election success.


Third term
“Today is the beginning of a process … in government, I am sure that the opposition parties would not be able to cooperate. In opposition, I see more chance for that,” said Adam Farkas, 21, a student.
“We disagree on many things … but we all want to live in Hungary and the main obstacle to that is Viktor Orbán .”
Orbán won a third straight term in power after a strong anti-immigration campaign. The strongest opposition party in the new parliament is the formerly far-right Jobbik, which has recast its image to be a more moderate nationalist force. Its leader resigned after the election.
The leftist opposition parties are also in turmoil.
“It is not Fidesz which won the election, the opposition parties lost it,” said Viktor Mikes, a 26-year old administrator at a multinational company. He said opposition politicians should all step aside, and that new people were needed.
“We should start with a clean slate,” he said.
The election victory appears to have emboldened Orbán to put more effort into his fight against the EU’s migration policies and harden his stance on NGOs that he says have been meddling in Hungary’s affairs.



Orbán wins legitimacy to continue challenging Brussels
Prime Minister Viktor Orbán won a third straight term in power in Sunday elections (8 April) after his anti-immigration campaign message secured a strong majority for his party in parliament, granting him two-thirds of seats based on preliminary results.


In an interview on Friday on state radio Orbán accused George Soros, the Budapest-born financier, of political activism in Hungary, saying his circle had supported the opposition.
“I know they won’t accept the result of the election, they will organise all sorts of things, they have unlimited financial resources,” Orbán said.
The foundation of George Soros on Friday accused Orbán of trying to stifle non-government groups, and said it could leave the country if parliament passes a “Stop Soros” law that would impose a 25% tax on foreign donations to NGOs that support migration.
The government says the legislation is meant to deter illegal immigration.



Hungarian people want to 'stop Soros', Orbán says
Hungary’s nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said Tuesday (10 April) that his resounding election win, challenged by the opposition, shows that voters want to stop US billionaire philanthropist George Soros interfering in the country.

Erdogan calls early elections under state of emergency, new purges underway
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on Wednesday (18 April) called snap elections for 24 June, saying economic challenges and the war in Syria meant Turkey must switch quickly to the powerful executive presidency that goes into effect after the vote.

Both Austria and the Netherlands have announced their governments would not look warmly to any possible campaigning on their soil by Turkish politicians.

In an interview with private NTV broadcaster, Erdoğan took aim at Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz who said Friday campaign events would “not be welcome” and would not be allowed.
Erdoğan said the steps taken by Kurz would “entirely turn against him.”
“Turkey’s struggle for democracy cannot be easily restricted,” he said.
The early election will accelerate the transition to a new presidential system which critics fear will lead the way for one man rule.
Kurz had told Oe1 radio Friday: “The Turkish leadership under Erdoğan has for years tried to instrumentalise communities of Turkish origin in Europe; this has been the case for Erdoğan’s campaign events and those of his supporters.”
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte also said Friday campaigning in the Netherlands would be “undesirable.”
“They are Turkish elections, so the campaign should remain in Turkey,” he said, warning that any campaigning by Turkish politicians could cause public disorder in the Netherlands.
Erdoğan said he would address Turkish origin voters in a European country without elaborating further.
“We have finalised our preparations abroad. I will not publicise the country now but God willing, I will address a crowd of 10-11,000 at a meeting of an international organisation,” he added.
Turkey’s EU Affairs Minister Omer Celik also blasted the prime ministers of Austria and the Netherlands, saying they were “not leaning on democratic values”.

“With this approach, Austria and Holland are poisoning democratic values in their own countries. By doing so, they are helping spread of racist political movements hostile to European Union values,” he wrote on Twitter Saturday.
Last year, Turkey’s relations with some of the EU member states including Germany, Austria and the Netherlands, took a strained turn after they banned rallies ahead of a constitutional referendum won by Erdoğan.

EURACTIV.fr reports.","https://www.euractiv.com/section/justice-home-affairs/news/meps-call-for-better-protection-of-journalists/","By Marion Candau | EURACTIV.fr | translated by Freya Kirk 23-04-2018 (updated: 24-04-2018 )","
                MEPs have called for an independent investigation into the murder of Slovak journalist Jan Kuciak and his fiancée and also demanded a better protection of investigative journalism. EURACTIV.fr reports.
On 25 February, the 27-year-old Kuciak and his partner Martina Kušnírová were found dead at their home. At the time, Kuciak was investigating the link between Italian and Slovak politicians with the Calabrian mafia.
His death unleashed a series of peaceful demonstrations in Slovakia (the biggest since the 1989 Velvet Revolution) which resulted in a political crisis that led to the resignation of Prime Minister Robert Fico.
The resolution was adopted on 19 April with 573 votes in favour, 27 against and 47 abstentions. It calls for a thorough and independent investigation of the murders led jointly with Europol, along with setting up national and European measures to better protect journalists and whistleblowers. It also suggests the establishment of a permanent EU scheme to support independent investigative journalism.
According to the European Parliament’s communiqué, it has “raised the alarm about the potential infiltration of organised crime in the Slovak economy and politics at all levels“.
“As Jean-Claude Juncker said, the killing or intimidation of journalists has no place in Europe or in any other democracy,” stated Julian King, Security Commissioner at the opening of the debate.
“In order to determine whether the investigation involves European funds and cross-border exchanges, it will require the full cooperation of OLAF (European Anti-Fraud Office). If fraud is proven, this will illustrate why we need the European public prosecutor.”



European Union to get a single public prosecutor
A Luxembourg-based chief prosecutor, first envisioned in the 2009 Lisbon Treaty, will start work next year after getting final approval from the European Parliament today.


MEPs are appalled at the fact that this double murder has been the second targeting an investigative journalist on European soil in the past six months. Daphne Caruana Galizia, a journalist from Malta, was killed in a car explosion on 16 October.
“Two respected investigative journalists have been murdered in Europe in the last six months. This shows how far organised crime members are willing to go to hide their financial activities and why the work of investigative journalists is so important,” stated the British MEP Claude Moraes (S&D).



Murder of Malta’s top investigative journalist provokes shock and outrage
Daphne Caruana Galizia, Malta’s top investigative journalist, was killed on Monday (16 October) when the car she was driving exploded shortly after she left her home.


Daphne Project
Daphne Caruana Galizia”s blog was the most read in Malta. In it, she denounced government corruption and worked on a high-level corruption network involving Maltese politicians. Joseph Muscat, who has been prime minister since 2013, was the main target of the journalist’s articles.
Eighteen international medias united under the name “Forbidden Stories” have decided to investigate her murder and continue her investigative work, a project now renamed “Daphne Project”.
According to Laurent Richard, editor-in-chief  of the production company Premières lignes and initiator of Forbidden Stories, the project’s aim is to give a strong message to enemies of the press by showing that there is no purpose in attacking a reporter, as behind the scenes there are 10, 20, 30 journalists who are ready to take over”.
The team started revealing on 17 April the results of their joint investigation. Le Monde, which is also participating, reported that the trail of political sponsors for the murder was dismissed by the police, yet, Economy Minister Chris Cardona was seen in a bar with one of the alleged killers a few weeks after the murder.
Cardona, who vehemently denied meeting the killer, then added that he “did not have any recollection of it”. Furthermore, the three alleged killers did not have any relation with the victim.
Forbidden Stories will keep publishing several chapters of the investigation over the next few days. The revelations of money laundering and corruption have shaken the Maltese parliament, the opposition now calls on the government “to tell the truth and stop ruining the country’s reputation,” states Le Monde.



‘Daphne project’ vows to disturb Malta’s corruption praxis
Marking six months since the murder of Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, an international consortium of journalists has started publishing further revelations aimed at uncovering the truth about her assassination and making sure her investigations live on.


Alarming situation
The three murders in six months have shocked the whole continent and revealed that the situation of journalists in many countries is still alarming.
The annual report published by Reporters Without Borders (RSF) last December stated that 65 journalists were killed worldwide in 2017. The trend is downward, which can be explained by “the many campaigns waged by international NGOs and media organisations on the need to provide journalists with more protection”.
This trend is also explained by the fact that journalists are leaving dangerous countries. The world’s deadliest countries for journalists are Mexico, Iraq and Afghanistan. Moreover, countries that do not respect the freedom of the press do not hesitate to imprison journalists. In 2017, 326 journalists were put behind bars (of whom 52 in China).
“Journalists have the right to investigate, to ask uncomfortable questions and to report effectively. This is what Jan Kuciak was doing, this appears to be why he was murdered.[…] Member states have a duty to make sure that press freedom and journalists are protected on their territory in a law and in spirit,” stated Commissioner Julian King.
            ","MEPs have called for an independent investigation into the murder of Slovak journalist Jan Kuciak and his fiancée and also demanded a better protection of investigative journalism. EURACTIV.fr reports. On 25 February, the 27-year-old Kuciak and his partner Martina Kušnírová were found dead at their home. At the time, Kuciak was investigating the link between Italian and Slovak politicians with the Calabrian mafia. His death unleashed a series of peaceful demonstrations in Slovakia (the biggest since the 1989 Velvet Revolution) which resulted in a political crisis that led to the resignation of Prime Minister Robert Fico. The resolution was adopted on 19 April with 573 votes in favour, 27 against and 47 abstentions. It calls for a thorough and independent investigation of the murders led jointly with Europol, along with setting up national and European measures to better protect journalists and whistleblowers. It also suggests the establishment of a permanent EU scheme to support independent investigative journalism. According to the European Parliament’s communiqué, it has “raised the alarm about the potential infiltration of organised crime in the Slovak economy and politics at all levels“. “As Jean-Claude Juncker said, the killing or intimidation of journalists has no place in Europe or in any other democracy,” stated Julian King, Security Commissioner at the opening of the debate. “In order to determine whether the investigation involves European funds and cross-border exchanges, it will require the full cooperation of OLAF (European Anti-Fraud Office). If fraud is proven, this will illustrate why we need the European public prosecutor.” European Union to get a single public prosecutor A Luxembourg-based chief prosecutor, first envisioned in the 2009 Lisbon Treaty, will start work next year after getting final approval from the European Parliament today. MEPs are appalled at the fact that this double murder has been the second targeting an investigative journalist on European soil in the past six months. Daphne Caruana Galizia, a journalist from Malta, was killed in a car explosion on 16 October. “Two respected investigative journalists have been murdered in Europe in the last six months. This shows how far organised crime members are willing to go to hide their financial activities and why the work of investigative journalists is so important,” stated the British MEP Claude Moraes (S&D). Murder of Malta’s top investigative journalist provokes shock and outrage Daphne Caruana Galizia, Malta’s top investigative journalist, was killed on Monday (16 October) when the car she was driving exploded shortly after she left her home. Daphne Project Daphne Caruana Galizia”s blog was the most read in Malta. In it, she denounced government corruption and worked on a high-level corruption network involving Maltese politicians.

But what chance does Ivica Todorić really have of getting a fair trial in the EU’s newest member state?","https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/the-brief-im-a-billionaire-get-me-out-of-here/","By Sam Morgan with Alexandra Brzozowski | EURACTIV.com 24-04-2018","
                A Croatian billionaire who set up one of the largest companies in the Balkans will be extradited back to his native country to face charges of fraud. But what chance does Ivica Todorić really have of getting a fair trial in the EU’s newest member state?
Todorić, aka the running man, made his fortune by founding Agrokor, a conglomerate that nearly collapsed last year under massive debt. The company accounts for 15% of Croatia’s GDP so it’s fair to say that the stakes are high in this case.
The phrase ‘too big to fail’ also comes to mind, hence the government’s massive effort to restructure Agrokor’s debt and keep it afloat.
The tycoon was accused of fraud, a charge he denies, although late last year he turned himself in to the British police after a Europe-wide arrest warrant was issued by Europol.
Todorić insists that the purpose of his stay in a posh residential area of London was not to escape Croatian justice but to prepare his defence. He also claims that he will not receive a fair trial in his homeland due to the political dimension of the Agrokor scandal.
But yesterday a British judge threw out Todorić’s plea and ruled that Croatia’s request for extradition should be granted. The chief magistrate refused to believe that political pressure would affect the chances of Todorić getting a fair trial.
But there may be an element of truth to Todorić’s worries about not getting a fair hearing.
Independent watchdog Freedom House’s annual democracy stock-take has warned that the Croatian judicial system “visibly deteriorated” in 2017. It cites the politicisation of the body that appoints judges, echoing fears that have been stoked in Brussels about Poland’s recent court reforms.
On a scale of 1 to 7, where 1 is the most democratic, Croatia scored 3.75 overall and just 4.5 for its judiciary, marking a slide in both cases since 2009, four years before the Adriatic nation joined the EU. That puts it below Bulgaria, Hungary and Poland.
There have been high-profile instances where the judiciary has been found wanting. A former prime minister’s case has dragged on for years and a well-known businessman was cleared of manslaughter after running over two swimmers with a boat, despite changing his story and despite having previous form.
That’s not to mention the Croatian media’s struggles. A delegation of press freedom experts has visited the country twice in the space of two years and has warned that there are serious concerns there.
Allegations of biased reporting by state-owned media, violence against journalists and even intelligence services agents turning up unannounced at a news channel have been made. That late-night visit was reportedly prompted by the station’s coverage of the Agrokor scandal.
So maybe Todorić has a point. Maybe the system that he took full advantage of to make his billions and, admittedly, provide employment for tens of thousands of people will now swallow him up if his appeal fails and he goes before a Zagreb court.
The Agrokor affair also raises questions about Croatia’s role in the EU. After all, plenty of headlines have been made lately about Poland and Hungary’s shortcomings, as well as Romania and Bulgaria’s ongoing struggles to satisfy Brussels’ ongoing justice monitoring.
Since the evidence shows the situation is getting worse, perhaps similar measures are needed or, at the very least, lessons have to be learned if the EU does indeed expand any time soon.
The Roundup
With Alexandra Brzozowski
Thank you, whistleblowers! After years of pressure, the Commission finally decided it will give more protection to individuals who expose fraud, tax evasion and data breaches.
Malta is on the EU’s radar this week, with Justice Commissioner Jourová travelling to the island nation to check progress on tackling money laundering and the murder case of Daphne Caruana Galizia.
The Council of Europe has appointed a special rapporteur to look into Malta, while a separate investigation into corruption in the Council itself threatens to have wide-reaching consequences. EPP President Joseph Daul called for members named in the report to be suspended.
Be sure to check out this interview with Russia’s man in Brussels.
French politicians have adopted a controversial draft law on asylum and immigration. But some of the provisions could be contrary to European law.
Commission Vice-President Dombrovskis told the UK’s financial sector that the EU and UK regimes could co-exist together after Brexit. But London will (obviously) be unable to shape the decision-making process.
Northern Europe has big wind power plans, with Belgium and Denmark in particular set to go big on turbines.
It’s a defining time for Theresa May’s government and she could face a no-confidence motion if things don’t go her way during a key vote on Thursday. An overseas travel form dated last year that put Strasbourg in Belgium suggests that luck (or competence) is not on her side though.
Apparently the European Parliament tried to roll out a new sorting system in its canteen today but it didn’t really go to plan…
Look out for…
Tomorrow is Liberation Day in Italy, celebrating the end of the Nazi occupation. Still no news on a government being formed though. President Sergio Mattarella has appointed a new mediator to see if there is any chance of the Five Star Movement and the Democratic Party teaming up (or not…)

Rama, in Berlin to lobby for the opening of accession talks after the European Commission gave its go-ahead last week, also condemned European politicians who stoked anti-Muslim sentiments, labelling them “investors in radicalisation”.

Ahead of a meeting later with Chancellor Angela Merkel, Rama warned that Russia was also intent on radicalising Albania’s Muslims, and urged the EU not to “leave a space for other countries to fill”.
The EU’s executive is keen to offer the prospect of membership to six Balkan states, including Albania, seeking to counter growing Russian and Chinese influence in the region.
The EU’S chief executive, Jean-Claude Juncker, said last week that the bloc needed to accept new members from the Western Balkans to avoid the risk of a new war there.



Commission proposes starting EU talks with Albania, Macedonia
The European Commission proposed on Tuesday (17 April) to open EU membership talks with Albania and Macedonia, in line with its new focus on the integration of the Western Balkans.


But member governments, mindful of popular scepticism about opening the EU’s doors to more poor countries, are more cautious.

From Britain to Hungary, populist parties have made electoral gains by playing on the alleged dangers of large-scale Muslim immigration, while the opening of west European labour markets to poorer new members has been blamed for stagnant wages.
“Statistically, Albania is a Muslim-majority country, but I would say the main religion in Albania is Europe,” Rama told Reuters. “So all these forces, they are practically the main investors in radicalisation from the side of Europe. So I abhor them.”
The closing off of a European perspective for Albania would also leave a gap that Russia was poised to exploit, he added, warning that Moscow’s alleged inteference in Montenegro’s 2016 election could be repeated elsewhere in the Balkans.
European officials have praised Albania’s progress in strenghtening the independence of its judiciary, combating corruption and embedding its democracy, but many in Brussels have been stung by perceived democratic backsliding of Hungary and Poland since joining in 2004.
Acknowledging that Albania could not guarantee it would not follow suit, Rama said his country had no alternative to pursuing European integration.
“It’s like what you ask of people when they get married,” he said. “You can’t ask more than their commitment to be together for the rest of their lives – and then things happen.
“It is important that our idealism about Europe be respected and not taken as naivete,” he added.

                The European Commission has threatened to introduce legislation on so-called fake news by the end of the year as part of its strategy to clamp down on online disinformation before the 2019 EU elections.
The Commission has given online platforms until July to draft a non-binding code of conduct aimed at reducing false information on social media. But if that strategy does not limit the spread of disinformation campaigns and the amount of fake accounts on the platforms, the EU executive said it will announce by December whether it will propose a hard law.
Mariya Gabriel, the EU digital Commissioner who has overseen the bloc’s strategy on fake news, told reporters on Thursday (26 April), “There’s no time to lose looking ahead to the 2019 European election.
“We need to be particularly vigilant and fight disinformation tactics, in particular targeting electoral processes.”
Gabriel and Julian King, the Commissioner in charge of the EU security union, told a news conference in Brussels that they want to prevent developments in Europe that might be similar to the spread of fake information on social media ahead of the 2016 US presidential election.
Facebook revealed last autumn that a Kremlin-linked agency paid for political advertising on the platform before the US election.
The Commission wants online platforms to come up with proposals that will make it clearer to social media users when they are seeing political ads and sponsored content. They should also make more information public about how their algorithms single out specific information to show users.
The Commission’s new strategy on false information uses some strong language to criticise online platforms—but it does not suggest any specific actions that it might include in future legislation. According to the EU document, false news “relies on a lack of transparency and traceability in the existing platform ecosystem and on the impact of algorithms and online advertising models”.
Gabriel has said she wants to stick to a voluntary agreement with platforms because they might remove false information more quickly without pressure from regulation.



Commission expert group pressures tech platforms to stop ‘fake news’ advertising
An expert group advising the European Commission on so-called fake news wants tech giants to be more transparent about their advertising revenue. Their new report pressures social media firms like Facebook and Twitter to deal with the spread of false information on their platforms.


Facebook already uses artificial intelligence to detect posts that spread incorrect claims, and the firm hired fact checkers in Italy ahead of this year’s election. After a strict new German law that regulates online hate speech went into effect in January, the social media giant also hired hundreds of new staff members there to monitor users’ posts.
The Commission announced that it will organise a conference with EU countries in late 2018 that will focus on “cyber-enabled threats to elections”.
One Commission official said that the new strategy focuses on legal “gray areas”, while Germany’s law targets posts with hate speech, which is illegal in the EU.
But the official described the Commission plan as an attempt to prevent fragmentation before other countries introduce their own national laws. France is also currently drafting its own legislation on fake news.
“It’s very clear that it’s a European problem,” the source said.
Commission officials cited a recent EU survey showing that 83% of respondents see “fake news” as a threat to democracy.
Earlier this year, the European Parliament also created a dedicated unit that will focus on preventing and responding to false information before the next EU election.
Consumer watchdog organisation BEUC criticised the Commission for taking a “half-hearted” position by failing to start a formal investigation into political advertising.
“Online platforms make money from advertisements displayed alongside fake news articles, videos and posts,” said Monique Goyens, BEUC’s director general.
Facebook and other social media firms have come under increased pressure for their advertising-based business models, and for allowing companies to access users’ personal data in order to target them with specific ads chosen for their interests and profile. This month, news broke that consultancy Cambridge Analytica had collected 87 million Facebook users’ data and analysed it without their consent for political campaign work.
Last year’s revelations about political advertising before the US election have already prompted a tougher approach from American lawmakers.
King referred during Thursday’s news conference to a draft bill regulating political advertising that the US Congress is currently discussing. It would require online platforms and media outlets to reveal how their ads target specific audiences and how much companies pay for ads.
The US honest ads act “has to grapple with some of these same issues” as the EU’s strategy, King said.
But he defended the Commission’s voluntary approach.
“I think we’re going in the right direction. I am reassured that the platforms as means of communication of much of this material understand the importance of making progress, will work with us and indeed already are taking steps in the right direction,” King said.



Facebook widens probe into alleged Russian meddling in Brexit
Facebook Inc said on Wednesday (17 January) it would conduct a new, comprehensive search of its records for possible propaganda that Russian operatives may have spread during the run-up to Britain’s 2016 referendum on EU membership.

The Commission wants online platforms to come up with proposals that will make it clearer to social media users when they are seeing political ads and sponsored content. They should also make more information public about how their algorithms single out specific information to show users. The Commission’s new strategy on false information uses some strong language to criticise online platforms—but it does not suggest any specific actions that it might include in future legislation. According to the EU document, false news “relies on a lack of transparency and traceability in the existing platform ecosystem and on the impact of algorithms and online advertising models”. Gabriel has said she wants to stick to a voluntary agreement with platforms because they might remove false information more quickly without pressure from regulation. Commission expert group pressures tech platforms to stop ‘fake news’ advertising An expert group advising the European Commission on so-called fake news wants tech giants to be more transparent about their advertising revenue. Their new report pressures social media firms like Facebook and Twitter to deal with the spread of false information on their platforms. Facebook already uses artificial intelligence to detect posts that spread incorrect claims, and the firm hired fact checkers in Italy ahead of this year’s election. After a strict new German law that regulates online hate speech went into effect in January, the social media giant also hired hundreds of new staff members there to monitor users’ posts. The Commission announced that it will organise a conference with EU countries in late 2018 that will focus on “cyber-enabled threats to elections”. One Commission official said that the new strategy focuses on legal “gray areas”, while Germany’s law targets posts with hate speech, which is illegal in the EU. But the official described the Commission plan as an attempt to prevent fragmentation before other countries introduce their own national laws. France is also currently drafting its own legislation on fake news. “It’s very clear that it’s a European problem,” the source said. Commission officials cited a recent EU survey showing that 83% of respondents see “fake news” as a threat to democracy. Earlier this year, the European Parliament also created a dedicated unit that will focus on preventing and responding to false information before the next EU election. Consumer watchdog organisation BEUC criticised the Commission for taking a “half-hearted” position by failing to start a formal investigation into political advertising. “Online platforms make money from advertisements displayed alongside fake news articles, videos and posts,” said Monique Goyens, BEUC’s director general. Facebook and other social media firms have come under increased pressure for their advertising-based business models, and for allowing companies to access users’ personal data in order to target them with specific ads chosen for their interests and profile. This month, news broke that consultancy Cambridge Analytica had collected 87 million Facebook users’ data and analysed it without their consent for political campaign work. Last year’s revelations about political advertising before the US election have already prompted a tougher approach from American lawmakers. King referred during Thursday’s news conference to a draft bill regulating political advertising that the US Congress is currently discussing. It would require online platforms and media outlets to reveal how their ads target specific audiences and how much companies pay for ads. The US honest ads act “has to grapple with some of these same issues” as the EU’s strategy, King said. But he defended the Commission’s voluntary approach. “I think we’re going in the right direction. I am reassured that the platforms as means of communication of much of this material understand the importance of making progress, will work with us and indeed already are taking steps in the right direction,” King said. Facebook widens probe into alleged Russian meddling in Brexit Facebook Inc said on Wednesday (17 January) it would conduct a new, comprehensive search of its records for possible propaganda that Russian operatives may have spread during the run-up to Britain’s 2016 referendum on EU membership.",156

                The summit held in Ankara on 4 April between Putin, Erdoğan, and Rouhani provides an eye-opening depiction of the rapidly changing discourse of 2018 geostrategic international rivalry, write Gilles Pargneaux, Dr Alon Ben Meir and Arbana Xharra.

The Syrian conflict, the center of global attention for more than seven years, is now in the hands of three actors – Russia, Turkey, and Iran. Europe appears to be incongruously helpless in the face of this geopolitical environment, the consequences of which bears directly on the Western alliance.
Here, the case of Turkey is worrisome. President Erdoğan’s horrifying human rights violations, his blind regional ambitions, the Islamization of Turkey, and exploitation of the Syrian refugees in Turkey (wielding them against Europe), coupled with his military incursion into Syria, demand that the EU immediately reconsider its relations with Turkey. The relationship must be redefined, given the changing regional and international geopolitical dimension that has a direct effect on the EU’s national security.
Bad news for Europe and the West 
The fact that the EU has been excluded from deliberations between Russia, Iran, and Turkey is a bad omen for the EU and the West in general. Much of the blame, however, rests with the EU in particular, as it has permitted Erdoğan to pursue policies domestically and internationally diametrically against EU interests, even though Turkey was going through the EU ascension process.
To be sure, the Ankara-Tehran-Moscow axis is marked by the growing triangular economic-military relations. Ankara’s purchase of Russian S-400 air defense missiles and the construction of a nuclear power plant by Russian company Rosatom in Turkey are only a few examples reflecting the deepening ties between the two sides. The summit in Ankara provided Erdoğan the platform he needs to project himself as the “leader of the Muslim world”, sending a clear message to the West that the “troika alliance” does not need the West’s input in solving Syria’s problems.
The EU must not underestimate the implications of this message. Kept unchallenged, this will have serious implications on the West’s regional allies in the Middle East
Between reconstruction of the Ottoman Empire and new Turkish strategic depth 
The 2016 failed military coup in Turkey further cemented Erdoğan’s authoritarian regime. The coup, which Erdoğan considered a “gift from God”, gave him the excuse to go on a rampage against his real or perceived enemies, targeting the press, the academia, the Kurds, and anyone who is suspected of having any affiliation with the Gülenists.
He was able to do that through changes to the Turkish Constitution and the use of Islam as Turkey’s new national identity, which could not be questioned without one being accused of blasphemy. Erdoğan’s express purpose is to rebuild a regional neo-Ottoman power, which directly contradicts the Kemalist – secular, democratic – nature of Turkey, and is certainly against Western values.
The policy of “zero problems with neighbors”, envisioned by former Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu, was thrown out of the window. Today Turkey has problems with every neighbor, as Erdoğan is bent on spreading Turkey’s influence and Islamic doctrine on many of its neighbors with the clear objective of acquiring strategic depth in the region.
The outlook for a new EU-Turkey relationship 
The authoritarian and strategic turn of Turkey calls for the EU to develop a new diplomatic strategy toward Turkey. Under Erdoğan’s leadership, Turkey obviously is no longer what it was hoped to be—a model of Islamic democracy that meets the principal requirements of the EU. Turkey’s diplomatic and military trajectory under Erdoğan will remain the same for years to come, and thus the process of Turkey’s accession to the EU must end. Moreover, the EU must not expand its commercial ties with Turkey unless there is an amelioration the situation of human rights in Turkey.  There cannot be such a thing as a double standard policy in our relation with Turkey.
Erdoğan ambition to reconstitute elements of the Ottoman era should have a chilling effect on any country with which Erdoğan seeks active bilateral relations. There are always sinister intentions behind his overtures, especially now that most of the countries in Balkans are in the process of negotiating entry to the European Union.
Therefore, the growing influence of Turkey in the Balkans cannot be ignored, where Turkey is systematically entrenching itself by increasing its commercial and cultural presence. The arrest of six Gülen-affiliated Turks residing in Kosovo on 29 March, the detention of Greek border guards to force the extradition of Turkish military, the Turkish promotion of Islamic studies, and the building of new or the rehabilitation of old mosques in Bosnia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Albania, and Serbia represent the latest avatars of this neo-Ottoman influence, tinged with political Islam, from Turkey to Europe.
To conclude, from the best ally of EU and NATO, Turkey turns out to be an ambiguous and resentful partner. In this moving international context, we cannot avoid a redefinition of our relationship with Turkey, without yielding to its provocations. Here is the path EU diplomacy should follow.

                “What we have in Armenia is a fantastically working revolution,” said Armen Grigoryan, one of the leaders of the “Reject Serzh“ movement, organising Armenia’s ongoing nation-wide protests. EURACTIV.sk reports.
Armen Grigoryan is one of the leaders of the“Reject Serzh“ civic initiative, the Armenian movement that stands behind the organisation of protests against the Prime Minister and former President Serzh Sargsyan. In 2015, Grigoryan was involved in organising protests against the constitutional reforms proposed by the Armenian government, which ensured Sargsyan’s stay in power after his term as President would come to an end in 2018.
EURACTIV Slovakia’s Lucia Yar talked to Grigoryan three days after he was released from police detention. Grigoryan, several other civic and opposition leaders, as well as Nikol Pashinyan, the leader of opposition party Way Out Alliance, were taken into custody hours after Pashinyan’s meeting with Sargsyan. A day after, a massive demonstration took place in the streets of Yerevan and as a result, Sargsyan stepped down.
How are you feeling now, after being released, especially after being involved in a movement that has finally succeeded?
I feel very inspired. The detention was not as difficult, and I was certain that I would be released. I was also certain that we would win this battle.
How did you end up in police custody?
The new Prime Minister Serzh Sargsyan called for negotiations and as I am one of the organisers of the protests and consider him a liar, I refused to discuss. As a result, they detained me along with other leaders, who were arrested on the same or on the next day. Overall, police treated us very respectfully, but they cut all my connections to the public. At times, they did not even let me contact my lawyer.

Your civil society engagement clearly led to that detention. How did the movement gain such power to threaten the rulers? 
Political parties in Armenia are active and represented by their initiatives. As a civil society, we have started our own initiative. At some point, we joined and started to call ourselves “Reject Serzh“. Our first march in early April involved about 150 people, it then grew to approximately 750 people. Later, with the “My Step” movement led by Nikol Pashinyan, we coordinated a 7 000-people demonstration, which turned into what we have today.
According to you, what was the last straw that led to people taking to the streets? 
He (Serzh Sargsyan) was the one to increase that “protest spirit”. Armenia’s external debt reached over $5 billion; there are over one million people living in poverty in the country; he didn’t play well in foreign politics; he even privatised the presidential residence. One of the last breaking points was when Nikol Pashinyan came to Yerevan.
There were also several actions led by the movement which convinced the public. One day we marched to Yerevan State University and called on students to join our march. Another day we went to the state radio and demanded to speak to the public, this had a great impact. Even the public radio director informed us that very few people would be listening at that time, it was rather symbolic to us.
Police used force and detained us, and many people claimed that after this, they were even more convinced to take to the streets. The biggest demonstration happened when around 15 protest leader were arrested on 22 April, 160,000 people took part in that demonstration.
How did the demonstration leaders cooperate?
It has been a very decentralised leadership involvement. Sometimes we personally decided to go ahead, as there was no time to discuss with each other. Way too many things happened, so we had to make decisions ourselves.
One of the most important tools we had was peaceful demonstrations, which worked great in both ways. People had power, they managed to block roads and took the responsibility. Even my own lawyer couldn’t reach me once the road was closed. She asked the local protest leader to let her get through to meet me but they refused, saying that the road is closed for everybody. People really gained power and changed the regime.
When did you hear about Sargsyan´s decision to step down? 
The morning (after the arrest) I was brought to the special investigation committee for questioning and I was considered a criminal, an activist.
I read about Sargsyan´s decision on my lawyer´s phone, which she showed me, someone had just written about it online. I showed the message to the investigator who was questioning me, and his face changed, and I told him: “Listen, don’t t do this anymore”. He took around ten minutes to check other sources and after that, he completely changed.

Will Sargsyan resume his political activity? As we have seen in some central European countries, for example, many stay behind. Armenia held its last general election a bit over a year ago. Won´t he become a mastermind behind the scene?
It would be very difficult to lead behind the scene, that is why he tried everything to stay in power. In Armenia, the institutions remain strong, not like in Poland, for example, where you do not need to be in state institutions to have power.
People have asked for snap elections. We ask for an interim government which would be led by representatives of the people. This interim government would have three fundamental aims: to change the electoral code, to change the central election committee and the law about political parties.
Realistically speaking, are those going to happen?
We are certain they are. There are still a lot of people on the streets and there is a huge hope in the society. The current government will not be able to meet society’s expectations. The strongest figure (Serzh Sargsyan) resigned, and others won’t be able to resist this movement.
Will Nikol Pashiyan become the next Prime Minister?
Most probably, but the point is that we want to have free elections. Our aim is to democratise Armenia, to ensure that institutions sustain the democracy that will come along in the future. There is always a probability that a government can be corrupt, and we want to make sure that the institutions are there to lead to polls.
We know that we cannot simply come and change everything from scratch, we first need to change the rules of the game.
Pashinyan had already met with EU representatives, as well as with the Russian ambassador. What role did international actors play and will play now? 
It’s important to make it clear that our revolution was only an internal issue, we didn’t allow any international actors to get involved or to support either side. The EU, the Russians, the West, were all interested but we kept the foreign affairs agenda away.
Many claim that with Sargsyan’s departure, Putin is losing an important ally in another post-Soviet country.
No, I am sure that once we become a democratic country, we will have better relations with the EU, Russia, France or Americans.
Will the partnership with the European Union remain at the top of the agenda after the revolution succeeds?
Not only with the EU, but also with the Western countries and Russia – our relations will become better in general. Once there is a democratic government and the public to support it, it will be easier to conduct transparent foreign relations. It will be more of a complementary policy, as we think that international actors will be our strong partners in the democratisation of the country.
What will happen over the next few days?
Over the next few days we will keep protesting as we believe that not all governmental figures are getting the public demands. For instance, until Wednesday (April 25), Karapetyan (the acting prime minister) was claiming to keep the power.
Yesterday´s demonstrations showed him that we are still here. At night there was a call for protests and in the morning the roads were already closed. We remain peaceful and this is very important. Even if the police beat us, we won’t seek revenge.

                The European Union will deploy a new financial weapon next week to try to rein in what Brussels sees as illiberal nationalism rising in the east of the bloc and threatening its democratic foundations.
A big electoral triumph on 8 April for Victor Orbán, the Hungarian leader EU chiefs call “The Viktator”, and a battle to save the independence of courts in Poland have sounded alarm bells about the Union’s future when Britain leaves next year.
President Jean-Claude Juncker’s European Commission, backed by Germany, France and the EU’s other wealthy paymasters, will unveil proposals on Wednesday as part of the 2021-2027 budget that will tie funding, on which poorer eastern countries rely, to respect for the rule of law, EU officials told Reuters.
“Conditionality will be there,” one senior source said. A second said the budget pressure would be a “game-changer”.
“We have leaders flirting with another set of values,” said a third, referring to Orbán’s call for “illiberal democracy” and his attacks on an open refugee policy which he says is promoted by Brussels officials set on imposing a new “empire” on Hungary.
“This is much more of a threat to Europe than Brexit.”



Germany to propose cutting funds to EU members that violate rule of law
European Union members that fail to meet EU standards on the rule of law could lose access to its financing under German proposals for the reform of the cohesion fund system seen by Reuters yesterday (30 May).


Budget details are still being hammered out and will be subject to arduous negotiations. But net EU spending accounts for more than 4% of public expenditure in Poland and over 7% in Hungary, and this is a factor in solid public support for EU membership in the two ex-communist states.
Under the proposals, funds could be withheld from countries which fail to abide by treaty obligations to respect the rule of law, such as by having independent courts.
The Commission believes it has a range of tools to clip the wings of its critics. Juncker’s goal, people familiar with his thinking say, is to heal an east-west rift before he steps down in 18 months and to bequeath a Union that is reshaping itself after losing one of its Big Three powers.
That dictates a softly softly approach which leaves critics of Orbán and Poland’s dominant politician, Jarosław Kaczynski, less than satisfied.



Katainen: For cohesion as well as migration, solidarity is not a one-way street
Commission Vice-President Jyrki Katainen reminded the Visegrád countries today (28 March) that the solidarity they expect from the EU’s cohesion policy also applies to the refugee crisis.


Poland yielding, Hungarian test 
EU officials expect Poland to back down enough next month on reforms of its judiciary to avoid the Commission having to follow through on a threat to try to suspend its EU voting rights — a compromise the EU executive believes will have been achieved through fear of penalties in the upcoming EU budget.
Tensions with eastern states could also be defused by tough EU action to keep out irregular migrants, by a prospective compromise on sharing out the task of looking after refugees and by efforts to deal with complaints from former Soviet-bloc countries that they are treated as second-class citizens.
“East to west: Europe must breathe with both lungs. Otherwise our continent will struggle for air,” Juncker said in September as he laid out policies for the rest of his mandate in what one aide described as “a love letter to eastern Europe”.
“We will work hard to keep them hooked in to the system,” said another. “With the right carrots — and sticks.”
The Commission faces a test of wills with Orbán. EU officials expect him to step up challenges to Brussels but say legal sanctions have forced him to back away from some actions and voice confidence that they can do so again.
Orbán has backed down after losing cases to the Commission in the European Court of Justice, including on a move to remove senior judges and a data privacy supervisor. He also accepted an ECJ rejection of his attempts to overturn a Union policy that would oblige member states to take in a share of asylum-seekers.
The executive expects to win cases, known as infringements, to block new Hungarian laws aimed at curbing funding from abroad, notably by Hungarian-American financier George Soros, of a university and of liberal non-government organisations.
The European Parliament has urged the Commission to launch moves to suspend Hungary. Opponents say more should be done to stop misuse of EU funds by businesses close to Orbán.
Benedek Jávor, a Hungarian opposition member of the European Parliament, says the Commission has been “too soft” and checks on the executive’s ability to step into national politics mean the system is “artificially paralysed”.
Countries face a high bar to prove democratic credentials to join the EU but sitting members face less scrutiny, he said.
Courting Poland
Poland will be the fifth biggest state in the post-Brexit EU and is, Commission officials say, more of a worry — the “test case” for curbing intolerant leaders.
But Poland’s ruling party, under Kaczynski, appears more responsive. As the EU began preliminaries to suspension in December, Kaczynski brought in a new prime minister who has engaged more actively in talks with Brussels to avoid censure.
EU officials say a deal under which Warsaw waters down bills on the appointment of judges could be struck next month, before budget talks start.
Brussels may not be fully satisfied but a compromise would send a signal to governments and end a row in the EU. As Orbán has said Hungary would veto suspension of Polish membership, launching Article 7 procedures would be of limited use anyway.
Other eastern governments have also been discreetly lobbying Warsaw to step back from confrontation. “We’re telling them ‘look, you’re endangering our budget funds too’,” said a senior diplomat from a country also heavily dependent on EU cash.



Oettinger wants ‘pact’ between net payers and net recipients
European Commissioner for the Budget Günther Oettinger arrives in Sofia on Friday (27 October), as part of a tour opening the debate on future EU finances.


Faced with the tricky task of defining when elected leaders are damaging democracy, the Commission has focused on economic regulation and frames moves to give governments influence over courts as undermining the EU’s open internal market.
Orbán’s attacks on Soros’s projects face infringement cases citing freedoms to move money across frontiers or to open a business.
The Court of Justice is also sharpening its tools. A recent ruling has updated EU jurisprudence on judicial independence and it is considering an Irish judge’s refusal to extradite a suspect to Poland over concerns about fair trials there.
There is also a growing willingness among the EU’s political leadership, notably among governments in many other member states, to take their peers to task over the summit table.
“Where once we spoke about fish and finance,” the EU official said. “We are now speaking about fundamental values.”
            ","The European Union will deploy a new financial weapon next week to try to rein in what Brussels sees as illiberal nationalism rising in the east of the bloc and threatening its democratic foundations. A big electoral triumph on 8 April for Victor Orbán, the Hungarian leader EU chiefs call “The Viktator”, and a battle to save the independence of courts in Poland have sounded alarm bells about the Union’s future when Britain leaves next year. President Jean-Claude Juncker’s European Commission, backed by Germany, France and the EU’s other wealthy paymasters, will unveil proposals on Wednesday as part of the 2021-2027 budget that will tie funding, on which poorer eastern countries rely, to respect for the rule of law, EU officials told Reuters. “Conditionality will be there,” one senior source said. A second said the budget pressure would be a “game-changer”. “We have leaders flirting with another set of values,” said a third, referring to Orbán’s call for “illiberal democracy” and his attacks on an open refugee policy which he says is promoted by Brussels officials set on imposing a new “empire” on Hungary. “This is much more of a threat to Europe than Brexit.” Germany to propose cutting funds to EU members that violate rule of law European Union members that fail to meet EU standards on the rule of law could lose access to its financing under German proposals for the reform of the cohesion fund system seen by Reuters yesterday (30 May).

                The EU will this week unveil its first formal plans for a larger, one-trillion-euro-plus long-term budget after Britain’s departure, which threaten to further deepen divisions in the bloc.
From slashed farm funds that will anger French farmers, to development cash tied to respect for democracy, and demands for greater national contributions, the 2021-2027 budget promises to be an explosive mixture.
EU Budget Commissioner Günther Oettinger, who will present the plans in Brussels on Wednesday (2 May), says that tough steps are needed to fill a 12 to 14 billion euro hole left by Brexit.



Oettinger: EU budget should increase despite Brexit funding gap
The EU’s next seven-year budget should increase the bloc’s spending, despite the impending departure of the UK from the bloc, the EU’s budget chief said on Wednesday (14 February).


A race against time will follow, especially as the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, wants the budget agreed before the next European Parliament elections in May 2019, two months after Britain leaves.
EU states say it is “impossible” given the rifts between east, west, north and south, with countries anxious not to put their hands in their pockets at a time when populism on the march.
“They have to take responsibility for the ambitions that they have expressed” for the EU after Brexit, an official in Jean-Claude Juncker’s commission said on condition of anonymity.



Juncker warns of cuts to MFF despite member states’ promised additional cash
Most EU leaders accepted on Friday (23 February) that they will add more funds to the EU budget after 2020, but European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said that funds for farmers and cohesion would still be reduced.


‘There will have to be cuts’ 
The loss of Britain deprives the EU of one of its biggest net contributor nations at a time when the bloc is trying to finance new areas such as defence and tackling migration.
Countries including Austria and the Netherlands are already gearing up to fight any demand for increased national contributions, although France and Germany have said they are ready to pay more.
The sums at stake in the budget debate are huge, even if on the face of it they only represent a tiny fraction of the overall wealth of the European Union — the current 2014-2020 budget represented just 1% of the bloc’s GDP.
Oettinger has called for countries to increase their contributions to “between 1.1% and 1.2%” of their national budgets for the next “multi-annual financial framework”.
But along with the new resources “there will have to be cuts,” the German commissioner has warned.
Sources said they would be “modest” amounting to less than 10%.
Most will target the two areas that together account for nearly three quarters of all EU spending.
The EU’s infamous Common Agricultural Policy is first in the crosshairs, accounting for 37% of the bloc’s spending. That will be difficult to swallow for France, whose farmers are the biggest beneficiaries of CAP funds.
Paris has said it is ready to defend “substantial reform” but the “indispensable security of aid for farmers cannot be affected”, a diplomatic source said.



Hogan: 3 reasons EU farmers should take the risk and invest in agriculture
European farmers should invest in post-2020 agriculture as it will be less bureaucratic, more focused on “technology breakthroughs” and will improve their standard of living, EU Commissioner Phil Hogan told EURACTIV.com.


‘Political pressure’ 
Also targeted will be so-called cohesion funds that are used to fund development in poorer European countries. They represent a further 35% of the EU’s budget.
Most of that money currently goes to eastern former Soviet bloc countries which are still catching up economically.
But southern nations such as Spain and Italy have started demanding that some is redirected to tackle mass youth unemployment in their countries.



Minister: EU cohesion policy served Greece well, should be upgraded in future
The EU’s cohesion policy supported Greece in its most serious crisis, demonstrating the value of the bloc’s second-biggest funding scheme, Greece’s Alternate Economy Minister Alexis Charitsis told EURACTIV.com in an interview.


The eastern countries are also alarmed by the commission’s plans to link the funds to respect for the rule of law.
Poland and Hungary, both criticised by Brussels over democratic issues, have battened down the hatches and say they are being criticised for failing to take in refugees.
“We will not accept arbitrary mechanisms which will make the funds an instrument of political pressure, Poland’s deputy European affairs minister Konrad Szymanski said.
Some of the money saved will be directed to guarding the EU’s frontiers in the wake of the migration crisis, with the Commission planning to more than quintuple the size of the Frontex border agency to nearly 6,000, a European source said.

                Most Swiss support the government’s plan to forge a new treaty with the European Union that would have arbitration panels to help settle disputes, a poll published on Sunday (29 April) showed.
The survey is important because under the neutral country’s system of direct democracy Swiss voters get the final say on a treaty that officials hope to agree this year. Bilateral ties are now based on a patchwork of sectoral accords.



Bern demands progress in Swiss-EU talks
Several political and economic issues remain open in neutral Switzerland’s talks on future ties with the European Union, the Bern government said on Wednesday (28 June), linking progress in negotiations to whether it continues to pay into the EU budget.


Fifty-four percent of respondents in the survey by polling institute GfS Bern backed the plan to have arbitration courts comprising representatives from Switzerland, the EU and a neutral party resolve disputes.
Even supporters of the far-right Swiss People’s Party, which opposes any new treaty, favoured this approach, the poll published by the NZZ am Sonntag newspaper found.
Only 4% of Swiss wanted the EU’s European Court of Justice to be the final arbiter of disputes, although the ECJ is envisioned to rule on matters to do with EU law. Thirty-five percent backed the current system in which a joint Swiss-EU commission is supposed to work out compromises on handling rows.
Poll coordinator Urs Bieri called the outcome “an impressive advantage for the start of (Foreign Minister Ignazio) Cassis’s negotiating strategy”, the NZZ said.



Swiss see no quick deal on new EU treaty
Switzerland will not meet the European Commission’s deadline for a deal in the early part of this year on a new treaty that would bind the neutral country more closely to its biggest trading partner, new Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis said.


The poll covered 2,500 respondents and had a margin of error of up to 2 points.
Switzerland in March revived plans to contribute an extra 1.3 billion Swiss francs (€1.08 billion) for newer European Union members as relations with its biggest trading partner began improving after a spat at the end of last year.
Diplomats say the mood has brightened since Bern laid out its negotiating position on the new treaty Brussels wants that would formalise ties.
The treaty would see the Swiss adopt EU laws governing the single market, with the ECJ giving its opinion on disputes on how to interpret single-market rules.
This is opposed by the anti-immigration People’s Party, the largest in parliament, which has two cabinet seats.
Many Swiss conservatives are also wary of giving “foreign judges” such power, so the idea of arbitration panels, which were first proposed by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in November, may help break the impasse.

                In Donbass, Ukraine is experiencing a catastrophe comparable with the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster. Now as then, it is urgent to restore the confidence of the affected people in the state and their trust in each other, argues Sergii Parashyn.
Sergii Parashyn is a board member of the Ukrainian Foundation for Democracy “People First” and former director of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.
On 26 April, we commemorated another anniversary of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant accident, which caused irreparable damage to the ecology of Ukraine, entailed large-scale destruction of infrastructure, colossal economic losses and evacuation of inhabitants from vast areas.
But, perhaps, the most negative consequence of the disaster was the infliction of a severe psychological trauma to the population. People were disoriented, felt insecurity about the future, they were afraid for their children and distrustful of the government.
Today, 32 years after the nuclear disaster, due to hostilities in Donbass and the loss of control over part of its territory, Ukraine is again experiencing a catastrophe, in the humanitarian dimension, comparable in scale to Chernobyl.
There are about 3.8 million people in the temporarily occupied territories, about 0.5 million people live in the so-called “grey zone”. Even in the big cities of the Separate districts of Donetsk and Lugansk regions (SDDLR), there is an atmosphere of anxiety and despondency.
It is not by chance that the Ferris wheel in the empty “1st of May” Entertainment Park in Lugansk reminded one well-known blogger of the Ferris wheel in Pripyat.
The psychological trauma suffered by residents of areas beyond Kyiv’s control as a result of military operations is further aggravated by resentment from the lack of care from the Ukrainian state, from the sense of humiliation and rejection that arises each time they have to pass control at the border crossing points, when they receive a pension or take children to a school located a few kilometres from the place of residence in the territory controlled by the Ukrainian military, etc.
Unfortunately, we have to acknowledge that today there is no effective state policy for ensuring the loyalty to the Ukrainian state of people living in temporarily occupied territories and in the “grey zone”.
The country runs the risk of losing the fight for those people, especially for the younger generation. To prevent this, there is a need to create a socialising, administrative, medical, educational and other infrastructure in the front-line zone, which would meet the needs of local residents, in particular in terms of respect and self-respect, and help restore confidence. In our view, elements of such an infrastructure, for example, could be:
“ideal” entry-exit points, equipped on the basis of the most modern technologies, ensuring fast and comfortable passage of all formal procedures;
“ideal” centres for the provision of administrative services, where you can easily and quickly draw up the necessary documents, get a pension, etc.;
information centres;
mobile children’s polyclinics;
children’s play centres;
schools for the development of gifted children talents;
shopping and service centres, etc.
The realities are that the Ukrainian government is neither financially nor organizationally able to develop and implement a project to create such an infrastructure independently. It should be reminded that the international effort to overcome the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster with the decisive participation of international partners of Ukraine (G-7, EU, UN) was successful and that it could be reproduced in Donbass.
This concerns both the content part (the formation of a comfortable humanitarian, social, information, service, etc. space, by creating an appropriate high-quality infrastructure with the involvement of Western specialists) and the institutional part (eliminating corruption risks and ensuring the reliability and sustainability of funding through the creation of a special Financial Fund for the project, controlled by the donor assembly).
Speaking about the need for Western and especially European support for the project, we proceed from the fact that the reason for the rebellion in Donbass was the course proclaimed by the Revolution of Dignity to deepen integration with the EU (through the signature of the Association Agreement), about which local residents, irradiated by Russian propaganda, had a highly distorted view.
We assume that the implementation of a set of measures to overcome the consequences of a humanitarian catastrophe in the East of Ukraine, based on European values (respect for human dignity, freedom, solidarity, equality) and financially supported by the European Union, will contribute to the loyalty of the population of Donbass to Europe, the European choice of Ukraine and to the Ukrainian state.
This will soon create favourable prerequisites for a future dialogue on the re-integration of the population of Donbass into Ukrainian society and the establishment of sustainable peace in the region.
We believe that the EU may be interested in such project in terms of its importance for the European security.
Judge for yourselves: the invasion of the Russian occupation forces in Donbas (as well as in Crimea), the permanent terror along the line of contact are, from the point of view of Russia, the punishment of Ukraine for its desire to get closer to Europe.
Similar, in fact, is the intimidation of countries that are inclined to political and economic rapprochement with the EU, including those covered by the Eastern Partnership policy (Moldova, Belarus, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan).
This, in turn, contradicts the interests of the EU, aimed at creating a belt of stability, democracy and security along the perimeter of its borders. By supporting Ukraine in the restoration of confidence in Donbass, the European Union will also be able to demonstrate that it is ready to help its partners, using soft power, economic and political levers.

The psychological trauma suffered by residents of areas beyond Kyiv’s control as a result of military operations is further aggravated by resentment from the lack of care from the Ukrainian state, from the sense of humiliation and rejection that arises each time they have to pass control at the border crossing points, when they receive a pension or take children to a school located a few kilometres from the place of residence in the territory controlled by the Ukrainian military, etc. Unfortunately, we have to acknowledge that today there is no effective state policy for ensuring the loyalty to the Ukrainian state of people living in temporarily occupied territories and in the “grey zone”. The country runs the risk of losing the fight for those people, especially for the younger generation. To prevent this, there is a need to create a socialising, administrative, medical, educational and other infrastructure in the front-line zone, which would meet the needs of local residents, in particular in terms of respect and self-respect, and help restore confidence. In our view, elements of such an infrastructure, for example, could be: “ideal” entry-exit points, equipped on the basis of the most modern technologies, ensuring fast and comfortable passage of all formal procedures; “ideal” centres for the provision of administrative services, where you can easily and quickly draw up the necessary documents, get a pension, etc.; information centres; mobile children’s polyclinics; children’s play centres; schools for the development of gifted children talents; shopping and service centres, etc. The realities are that the Ukrainian government is neither financially nor organizationally able to develop and implement a project to create such an infrastructure independently. It should be reminded that the international effort to overcome the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster with the decisive participation of international partners of Ukraine (G-7, EU, UN) was successful and that it could be reproduced in Donbass. This concerns both the content part (the formation of a comfortable humanitarian, social, information, service, etc. space, by creating an appropriate high-quality infrastructure with the involvement of Western specialists) and the institutional part (eliminating corruption risks and ensuring the reliability and sustainability of funding through the creation of a special Financial Fund for the project, controlled by the donor assembly). Speaking about the need for Western and especially European support for the project, we proceed from the fact that the reason for the rebellion in Donbass was the course proclaimed by the Revolution of Dignity to deepen integration with the EU (through the signature of the Association Agreement), about which local residents, irradiated by Russian propaganda, had a highly distorted view. We assume that the implementation of a set of measures to overcome the consequences of a humanitarian catastrophe in the East of Ukraine, based on European values (respect for human dignity, freedom, solidarity, equality) and financially supported by the European Union, will contribute to the loyalty of the population of Donbass to Europe, the European choice of Ukraine and to the Ukrainian state. This will soon create favourable prerequisites for a future dialogue on the re-integration of the population of Donbass into Ukrainian society and the establishment of sustainable peace in the region. We believe that the EU may be interested in such project in terms of its importance for the European security. Judge for yourselves: the invasion of the Russian occupation forces in Donbas (as well as in Crimea), the permanent terror along the line of contact are, from the point of view of Russia, the punishment of Ukraine for its desire to get closer to Europe. Similar, in fact, is the intimidation of countries that are inclined to political and economic rapprochement with the EU, including those covered by the Eastern Partnership policy (Moldova, Belarus, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan). This, in turn, contradicts the interests of the EU, aimed at creating a belt of stability, democracy and security along the perimeter of its borders. By supporting Ukraine in the restoration of confidence in Donbass, the European Union will also be able to demonstrate that it is ready to help its partners, using soft power, economic and political levers.",162

                The only Grexit scenario that is currently on the table is the one from the bailout programme, Angel Gurría, the Secretary-General of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), said on Monday (30 April).
“The foundations for a sustainable and fair growth have been laid, also in the long run,” Gurría emphasised at a meeting with Greek Premier Alexis Tsipras in Athens.
He also praised the leftist prime minister who “brought Greece back from the edge of the cliff”.
In its Economic Survey of Greece 2018, OECD confirms the recovery of the Greek economy and forecasts a 2% growth in 2018 and another 2.3% in 2019, with the main drivers the investments, exports and increasing private consumption.
“We are in a situation where growth could be underestimated in the evidence that we currently have. In the longer term, we may eventually reach a more sustainable level of sustainability. You are ready to jump.”
As far as the primary surplus targets are concerned, OECD noted that Greece would reach and even exceed the objectives of the ESM program by 2019.
In particular, it sets the bar lower by 2017, projecting a 3.7% primary surplus of the GDP, which will reach 4% in 2018 and 3.6% in 2019.
At the same time, it projects steadily declining unemployment, which is expected to fall from 21.5% in 2017 to 20.4% in 2018 and to 19.4% in 2019.
As far as the debt issue is concerned, OECD noted that despite the consistency that Greece has shown in promoting reforms and meeting high fiscal targets, its public debt that has reached 180% of GDP remains among the highest in the world.
The report points out that while the primary objective should be maintaining the fiscal stability and sustaining high growth rates, measures to alleviate Greek debt should, in any case, be made to make its repayment viable.
The report is also positive about the changes in tax administration and spending management, but highlights the need to increase the rate of revenue collection as “two out three euros from VAT are lost due to tax evasion”.
Among the future challenges for the Greek economy, OECD emphasised the “reforms’ fatigue”, the geopolitical tensions in the Mediterranean that could increase the flow of immigrants, as well as a potential financial crisis – not created by Greece – that could lead to a need to recapitalise major Greek bank, which the private sector will not have the will to cover.
“The Greek economy does not need any additional burdening measures but a well-prepared plan to pursue reforms and relieve the economy in order to create room for further growth,” Alexis Tsipras said.
On 27 April, the Greek government presented its own growth strategy for the post-bailout era, which, according to Bloomberg, focuses on the implementation of structural reforms that have been delayed for years, such as the creation of the Land Registry and the speedier administration of justice decisions.



Minister: EU cohesion policy served Greece well, should be upgraded in future
The EU’s cohesion policy supported Greece in its most serious crisis, demonstrating the value of the bloc’s second-biggest funding scheme, Greece’s Alternate Economy Minister Alexis Charitsis told EURACTIV.com in an interview.


The country’s lenders and the EU institutions have said that Greece is exiting the bailout in August, after almost 9 years of crisis.
Opposition asks for snap elections 
Meanwhile, the main opposition centre-right New Democracy party does not share the government’s optimism and calls for a snap national election.
The government’s mandate ends in 2019 and it has repeatedly said that it would serve its full term.
“If Mr Tsipras really believes, as he claims, that he is successfully closing a chapter for the country in August, let him hold elections in September,” New Democracy said in a statement.
On the other hand, the government says that the only ones who do not see the country’s progress are the New Democracy lawmakers and urges the EPP affiliate to see the reality.
New Democracy has also stressed that it would not commit to the government growth plan if it came to power.
However, the business community does not positively view either the call for a snap election or the lack of consensus on the growth plan.
“The discussion about early elections must come to an end as it causes turmoil in the economy and in society,” said Konstantinos Michalos, president of the Athens Chamber of Commerce and Industry and deputy president of the Association of European Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Eurochambres).
Michalos, who is known for his centre-right political beliefs, continued by saying those who demand an election when there is a national crisis “do not seem to be talking to the ones they have to [business community]”.

                France’s Marine Le Pen led a rally of Europe’s far-right in the southern French city of Nice on Tuesday (1 May), to celebrate recent gains on the continent and devise a battle plan for next year’s European elections.
The National Front leader is hoping to bounce back from her defeat in last year’s presidential vote in the May 2018 elections to the European Parliament.

But there were key absences from the Nice meeting of parties from the Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF) grouping, revealing cracks in Le Pen’s bid to create a grand alliance of Europe’s far right.
“Europe is a good idea but the European Union is killing it,” Le Pen told the rally on May Day, which was attended by the secretary general of Austria’s far-right FPÖ, Harald Vilimsky, whose party entered government in December.

“The possibility of obtaining a majority to change Europe is not so far-fetched. It’s up to us to build this historic victory,” she urged.
After setbacks in France and the Netherlands in the first half of 2017 eurosceptic parties have chalked up major gains in several countries around Europe.
In Germany, the anti-immigration AfD in Germany garnered almost 13% of the vote in September’s election; in Hungary, nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orbán was re-elected to a third term with a thumping majority last month; and in Italy, the eurosceptic League party is vying to form a government. Although ideologically close to the far right, Orbán is officially affiliated to the centre-right EPP.
League leader Matteo Salvini did not attend Tuesday’s rally but sent a video message of support instead.

Another star invitee, Dutch anti-Islam politician Geert Wilders, also failed to show up.
A senior FN official, Nicolas Bay, told AFP that Wilders “had urgent business that required him to stay in the Netherlands”.
Among those who attended were representatives of the Polish Congress of the New Right, the Czech Republic’s SPD party and Bulgaria’s Volya.

The Congress of the New Right is a Eurosceptic force founded in 2011 by Janusz Korwin-Mikke, who was ousted in 2015. The force is now led by Stanisław Żółtek, an MEP.
The Czech SPD (Freedom and Direct Democracy, led by Tomio Okamura) has called for the country to quit the EU, pushing for a referendum similar to when Britons voted for Brexit in 2016.

Bulgaria’s Volya party is led by businessman Vesselin Mareshki, sometimes called the ‘Bulgarian Trump’. Mareshki owns a chain of petrol stations and pharmacies and succeeds in selling fuel and medicines at prices well below the rest of the competition. Mareshki positions himself as oppositions, but in fact supports the Borissov government.

Le Pen has been struggling to recover from her stinging defeat by centrist Emmanuel Macron in the run-off of last year’s presidential election.
The FN leader took 36% of the vote — a historic performance for the party which nonetheless fell short of expectations.

Drawing the lessons of her failure, she has softened her policies on Europe which had scared off many voters.
She has ditched her unpopular proposal to quit the eurozone and organise a referendum on leaving the European Union.
Instead, she favours transforming the EU into a club of nations that work together independently.

That is not entirely correct but there are important decisions to make in Finland. EURACTIV Germany’s media partner “WirtschaftsWoche” reports.","https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/expert-basic-income-experiment-did-not-fail/","By Kristina Antonia Schafer | WirtschaftsWoche | translated by Alexandra Brzozowski 02-05-2018","
                The Finnish basic income experiment is currently causing a stir, some even declare it has failed. That is not entirely correct but there are important decisions to make in Finland. EURACTIV Germany’s media partner “WirtschaftsWoche” reports.
If Olli Kangas understood German, he would have rubbed his eyes in amazement last week. Kangas is a professor and director at Kela, the research institute of Finnish social security, which is currently conducting a much-noticed experiment on unconditional basic income.
This experiment will be phased out by the end of the year, with no prospect of succeeding. Many news sites rated this as a failure of the experiment; some even wrote that it would end prematurely.
“These articles are not true,” Kangas said when asked by WirtschaftsWoche. “This is fake news.”
The experiment is running exactly as it was planned almost two years ago: from the beginning of 2017 until the end of 2018 with 2,000 randomly selected persons who receive an unconditional basic income of 560 euros per month during this time. The Finnish government has not actively opposed the continuation of the experiment but is leaving it running as planned.
Which does not mean, however, that Kangas would not like to continue the experiment, under different conditions – with more money, more participants, and more time.



Parliament plenary rejects universal basic income
The European Parliament’s plenary session voted today (16 February) against a universal basic income to compensate for the impact of robots on the labour market.


When the Kela experts designed the first research design, they already had bigger ideas. In the current experiment, only 2,000 unemployed people receive the basic income. Kangas and his colleagues wanted to involve peer groups, such as the self-employed and white-collar workers, a total of 10,000 people, over a longer period of time. But the government shrank from the high cost and instead went for a much slimmed-down variant.
Kangas refers to this discrepancy between his original, exalted plans and the current study being implemented, saying that the time and financial scope of the experiment were not enough for valid reasoning. He still hopes that politics will enable him to do that someday – but in the end, if’s for the finance ministry to decide.
However, Kangas is unlikely to hear such a decision in the forthcoming months. The election campaign has begun in Finland; parliamentary elections are scheduled for April 2019. Until then, the centre-right government does not want to risk new experiments but to sharpen its profile in order to mobilise voters.



Inspiring new forms of debate to boost participatory democracy in Europe
The new president of the European Economic and Social Committee, Luca Jahier, intends to promote a new culture of dialogue around sustainable development, culture, peace and youth, in order to bring citizens closer to the European project.


In December, for example, it passed harsher penalties for unemployed people who cannot demonstrate at least 18 hours of work in three months. An innovation that is diametrically opposed to the idea of basic income, as Miska Simanainen, one of the lead researchers of the Basic Income Experiment, pointed out.
However, it has no influence on whether the basic income will be introduced at some point. Then, in any case, the entire system would have to be changed from the ground up. Until then realpolitik is on the agenda – and that is highly debated. “There are currently many discussions in Finland about the basic income and its alternatives,” said Simanainen.
“For now” means basically until April 2019, as long as the election campaign is running. Whether there will be a new experiment under a new government, whether the basic income is directly introduced or, on the contrary, buried, will only be decided afterwards.
The Greens, now in opposition, have already spoken out in favour of the basic income. The Centre Party, which so far has provided the Finish prime minister and has helped to launch the experiment, did so as well.
Now everyone is waiting for the evaluation of the experiment. According to Simanainen, the first results are expected to be released before the election and may influence who will form Finland’s next government.

Inspiring new forms of debate to boost participatory democracy in Europe The new president of the European Economic and Social Committee, Luca Jahier, intends to promote a new culture of dialogue around sustainable development, culture, peace and youth, in order to bring citizens closer to the European project. In December, for example, it passed harsher penalties for unemployed people who cannot demonstrate at least 18 hours of work in three months. An innovation that is diametrically opposed to the idea of basic income, as Miska Simanainen, one of the lead researchers of the Basic Income Experiment, pointed out. However, it has no influence on whether the basic income will be introduced at some point. Then, in any case, the entire system would have to be changed from the ground up. Until then realpolitik is on the agenda – and that is highly debated. “There are currently many discussions in Finland about the basic income and its alternatives,” said Simanainen. “For now” means basically until April 2019, as long as the election campaign is running. Whether there will be a new experiment under a new government, whether the basic income is directly introduced or, on the contrary, buried, will only be decided afterwards. The Greens, now in opposition, have already spoken out in favour of the basic income. The Centre Party, which so far has provided the Finish prime minister and has helped to launch the experiment, did so as well. Now everyone is waiting for the evaluation of the experiment. According to Simanainen, the first results are expected to be released before the election and may influence who will form Finland’s next government.",165

                A major innovation in the next long-term EU budget proposed by the European Commission yesterday (2 May) is the conditionality between EU funding and the rule of law. But the country holding the EU Presidency voiced its own clear rejection.
The Commission is proposing a new mechanism to protect the EU budget 2017-2021 from financial risks linked to deficiencies in the rule of law in member states. The move was expected in reaction to Poland, the first and only country so far to be subject of the “rule of law” mechanism, for what the Commission sees as a systemic risk for its democracy, as well as Hungary, which may follow, as it continues to institutionalise its “illiberal democracy”.



EU mulls new link between budget and rule of law
The EU’s justice commissioner is working on a proposal that could oblige member states such as Poland, which has clashed with Brussels over reforms to its courts, to pass tests on the independence of their judicial systems before receiving funding.


More widely, the conditionality could play in the case of the Visegrad countries (Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia), who refuse to be part of solidarity mechanisms to share the burden of the refugee crisis.



Katainen: For cohesion as well as migration, solidarity is not a one-way street
Commission Vice-President Jyrki Katainen reminded the Visegrád countries today (28 March) that the solidarity they expect from the EU’s cohesion policy also applies to the refugee crisis.


The new proposed tools would allow the Union to suspend, reduce or restrict access to EU funding. Such a decision would be proposed by the Commission and adopted by the Council through reverse qualified majority voting.
Poland reacted warily to the idea.
“There can be no space for arbitrariness,” Poland’s deputy European affairs minister Konrad Szymanski said in a statement.
But Szymanski, reflecting his government’s recent bid to resolve its two-year standoff with Brussels, said Warsaw did not see the proposals as “confrontational”.
Against EU treaties
Bulgaria, the country holding the rotating EU presidency, offered a stronger reaction.
Answering a question by the website Mediapool.bg does Bulgaria approve linking the disbursement of EU funds with the rule of law, Finance Minister Vladislav Goranov said:
“I can define the rule of law as the supremacy of the rules. It is not by accident that many philosophers believe that only the law can give freedom to any society. In this sense, we should not be against this. Another issue is if the rule of law is used to try to impose political interference or unequal treatment of individual countries – the principle of equal treatment is enshrined in the law also in the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU and if someone tries to impose regulation without rules, this is just as damaging as violating the rules.”
He added that Bulgaria would not comment further during its Presidency, as in its present role its duty is to seek consensus.
Romania is one of the countries to have rejected the idea of a EU funding conditionality since its inception, on the grounds that it doesn’t conform to the EU treaties.



Romania backs Poland in rejecting EU funding conditionality
Romania backed Poland yesterday (1 February) in vehemently rejecting proposals to tie future European Union subsidies to member states’ adherence to the rule of law.


In contrast, the Czech Republic, the country of Věra Jourová, who as Commissioner responsible for justice is behind the idea of the conditionality mechanism, made positive assessments regarding the proposed budget and the modalities of its allocation.
Czech State Secretary for EU affairs Aleš Chmelař said on Twitter the budget was “good news for the Czech Republic”
“There is more money for security, migration management, Erasmus and the space activities. The proposal also includes more flexibility within the cohesion policy. That was our priority.”

                Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who famously called the coup attempt of 15 July 2016 ‘a gift from God’ has held the Gülen movement solely responsible for the putsch without presenting any compelling evidence, writes Ramazan Güveli.
Ramazan Güveli is Director of Intercultural Dialogue Platform, Brussels.
The Turkish government, led by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, is waging a ruthless war against the Gülen or Hizmet movement on all possible fronts. Since the failed coup of 2016, more than 160,000 people have been sacked from government offices, and 60,000 have been jailed, of whom at least 17,000 are women, and there are over 700 children in jail. The latest victim of this reckless crackdown is Halime Gülsu, a 34-year-old teacher arrested in February for allegedly helping the Gülen movement, who died in prison last week, as she was not permitted to take her medicines.
President Erdoğan and his ministers proudly announce that 83 Hizmet-affiliated people have been snatched from abroad and taken to Turkey. The most recent abduction was of six Turkish nationals from Kosovo, which was roundly condemned by the European Union.
Erdoğan, who famously called the coup attempt of 15 July ‘a gift from God’ has held the Gülen movement solely responsible for the putsch without presenting any compelling evidence. The evidence presented to the EU has not convinced one single member yet, which is why the EU states have resisted the Turkish government’s countless initiatives to declare the Gülen movement a terrorist organization.
Despite Erdoğan’s ‘terrorist’ label, the West looks at actions and concrete evidence rather than just words. Hizmet movement participants have not been involved in one single violent incident throughout the movement’s 50-year history. In fact, Fethullah Gülen immediately condemned the coup and repeatedly called for the international committee to investigate it. Gülen also wrote to the New York Times that ‘if somebody who appears to be a Hizmet sympathizer has been involved in an attempted coup, he betrays my ideals.’
In an interview with EURACTIV, the Turkish Ambassador to the EU shockingly twisted the facts that were presented in the European Commission’s Turkey Progress Report published on 17 April. The ambassador gives readers the impression that the EU has referred to the Gülen movement as ‘FETÖ’, an acronym used by the Turkish government for ‘Fethullah Terrorist Organization’ and that the group is now classified as a terrorist organization.
The claim was made by the pro-government media several days before the publication of the report and was flatly denied by the Commission. When the report officially became public, it was clear that there was not one single reference to the movement using the pejorative term ‘FETÖ’. To the disappointment of the Turkish government and apparently of the Ambassador, the EU refused to call the Gülen movement terrorist despite all the hard work of the Turkish top diplomat in Brussels. The report makes it abundantly clear that the Commission is not convinced at all to dub the Gülen movement terrorist, whereas it is convinced that Turkey under Erdoğan is making great leaps backwards, away from EU standards and norms.
The Commission’s report praises Turkey’s efforts on the migration deal with the EU and for its economic growth. When compared to previous reports, it appears to be written more tactfully to ease the reactions of Ankara on certain issues. Nevertheless, this year’s Progress Report, which is being called by many ‘the regression report’, rightly highlights the serious backsliding of Turkey in most areas of democracy. ‘Backsliding’ is indeed one of the most frequently recurring words throughout the report. It boldly highlights that ‘serious backsliding on the rule of law, fundamental freedoms and freedom of expression’ has been observed. The report also urges Turkey ‘to lift the state of emergency without delay.’ Furthermore, it states that ‘under the currently prevailing circumstances, no new chapters are considered for opening.’ This practically means ‘de facto suspension’ of the accession talks, which is not good news for Turkey’s bumpy journey to membership. As Commissioner Hahn said, Turkey needs ‘to reverse this negative trend in rule of law and fundamental freedoms’ and take positive steps to fulfil EU principles.
Despite Ankara’s attempts at blackmail, Hizmet participants will carry on their good work and continue contributing to their local communities and having a positive impact in Europe. If they are educators they will continue to provide the best education to their students, if they are journalists, they will continue to stick to the principles of free media, and if they are involved in any charitable activities they will exert themselves to reach everyone who is in need.

                Britain’s historic decision to compel its overseas territories to identify the owners of registered companies marks a “significant” moment in the global crackdown on dirty money, campaigners said Wednesday (2 May).
On Tuesday, Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservative minority government acknowledged it would not be able to block an amendment in the House of Commons backed by many of its own MPs.
Territories like the Cayman Islands, the British Virgin Islands and the Turks and Caicos Islands will have until December 31, 2020 to create public registers of so-called beneficial ownership or face direct intervention by London.
May, who had favoured a more consensual approach, changed her stance following MPs’ demands to improve transparency.
“The UK parliament… has taken a significant step toward global tax transparency by imposing public registers of beneficial ownership of companies on the UK’s overseas territories,” said the Tax Justice Network (TJN) campaign group.
“Until now, UK governments and parliamentarians have been unwilling to impose greater transparency.
“Despite the UK being legally responsible and able to do so, no action has been taken.
“But cross-party and opposition support in the UK parliament means that… an amendment was passed as part of the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Bill, requiring the OTs to create public registers of beneficial ownership of companies — meeting the emerging international standard.”



EU denounces 'shocking' Paradise Papers revelations
The European Union on Monday (6 November) denounced the “shocking” revelations on the way top companies and dignitaries, including Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II, avoid taxes using offshore wealth hubs.


Opposition Labour MP Margaret Hodge had tabled the amendment to the sanctions and anti-money laundering bill.
The development “is good news for the protection of human rights and democracy across the globe, and bad news for tax dodgers, money launderers and kleptocrats”, added Markus Meinzer of the TJN.
“The risks for dirty business ending up in bright daylight is increasing. Let’s now move on to tackle the next strongholds of financial secrecy — there are enough left for a lifetime.”
Anti-corruption campaign group Global Witness also applauded the news.
“By agreeing to push the UK’s overseas territories to publish public registers of the real owners of their companies, the UK has led the world in one of the biggest moves we have seen in the fight against corruption for years,” it said.
“So many of our investigations over the years have revealed (that) corrupt officials… mobsters and oligarchs use companies registered in these territories… to hide their criminal activities,” noted Global Witness.
EU blacklist
In December 2017, the European Union adopted a blacklist of 17 non-EU tax havens after a year of tough negotiations but subsequently removed nearly half.



EU adopts list of 17 tax havens, Panama first to protest
The EU finance ministers adopted yesterday (5 December) a list of “non-cooperative tax jurisdictions”, which is another way to label tax havens.


Last year’s Paradise Papers leaks gave new impetus to a global crackdown, making public some of the intricate ways the world’s rich evade tax using offshore havens.
“The anonymous companies for sale in these jurisdictions allow the corrupt and the criminal to steal, hide and move suspect funds around the world,” said Global Witness.
“And over a year ago, the Panama Papers demonstrated their importance, as they revealed that more than half of the companies named in the papers were registered in the UK’s overseas territories.”
Transparency International, another campaign organisation, has described Britain’s vote as a “hugely significant moment in the fight against corruption”.

                MEPs condemn ‘mercy killing’ in other countries, but are turning a blind eye to European abortion laws that discriminate against foetuses on the grounds of disability, writes Alice Neffe.
Alice Neffe is Legal Counsel for ADF International
Last month, the European Parliament condemned “mercy killing”, a practice in Uganda whereby parents of disabled children kill or “allow them to die” by denying them medical attention because of the belief that these children are better off dead than living with a painful and incurable disability. The resolution strongly condemns what it describes as the “unjustifiable and inhumane killing of children and new-borns with disabilities.”
It therefore calls upon the Commission and Member States to support all stakeholders in Uganda in the formulation and implementation of policies addressing the needs and rights of persons with disabilities, “based on non-discrimination and social inclusion, and equal access to healthcare and other social services.” With this resolution, the European Parliament positioned itself as a defender of the most vulnerable in our societies, such as children with disabilities. However, its failure to prevent acts ending the lives of children with disabilities, because of their disability, right here in Europe undermines its overseas proclamations.
Across Europe, legislation regarding abortion violates the most fundamental rights of disabled people. Repeatedly, the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has condemned selective abortion on the grounds of disability. In particular, it has recommended a modification of the abortion legislation in Spain, Hungary, Austria, and the United Kingdom. Recently, the Committee stated that laws which explicitly allow for abortion on grounds of impairment violate the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
All Member States and the European Union itself have ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. While the EU has no competence to regulate abortion, it has committed itself to the protection and promotion of the substantive rights enshrined in the Convention, including equality and non-discrimination and the right to life.
Yet, none of the European institutions condemn the discrimination of disabled people through abortion policies and legislation in Europe or abroad. To the contrary, a few months ago, in a resolution on rule of law and democracy in Poland, the European Parliament strongly criticised legislative proposals that would prohibit abortion in cases of severe or fatal foetal impairment.
Poland allows abortion in three cases: when the pregnancy threatens the life or health of the mother; when the pregnancy is the result of a crime such as rape or incest; and when medical opinion indicates that the child might be born with a disability.
The “disability” ground for abortion is about ending the life of an unborn child who does not perfectly correspond to what society considers “healthy” or “desirable”. By allowing this, the provision compromises the rights of people with disabilities. Furthermore, it influences our perception on people with disability and sends a clear message: unborn children with a potential disability are not full members of our society and rights bearers just as every other person.
In 2002, 159 abortions were performed under the Polish law. By 2016, that had risen to 1,098 cases – a rise of 600%. And yet, it is not even the growing number of abortions that speaks the loudest. Out of these 1,098 abortions, 1,042 were performed because the child was potentially disabled.
Legislation is a powerful tool, not only reflecting but also shaping the society that it regulates. If legislation mirrors society, then at present, Poland’s abortion laws mirror a society on the way to eradicating disability, not by humane medical research and innovation, but by taking the lives of children in the womb. Therefore, the citizens’ legislative initiative “Zatrzymaj aborcję” (“Halt abortion”) drafted the bill (nr 2146), which is currently before the Polish Parliament. The aim of the bill is to stop with the obvious discrimination allowed under Poland’s current abortion law listing disability as a ground for abortion and violating the very idea of equal rights.
Legislation is not the only source stigmatising persons with disabilities. The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has identified antenatal screening policies as potentially discriminatory against unborn persons with disabilities. It recommended States to “address stigmatisation through modern forms of discrimination, such as a disability-selective antenatal screening policy that go against the recognition of the equal” to 90% in Norway, and 90% in the United Kingdom. In the United States, it is 67%. In Poland, over 37% of abortions performed on the ground of the disability of the unborn child were caused by the possibility of the child having Down syndrome.
Life with a disability can certainly be a challenge for the person and their family. However, there are many examples of those living with disabilities leading exceptionally fulfilled and fruitful lives. A case in point is Professor Stephen Hawking. He recently passed away aged 76 after leading an incredible life of discovery and contribution to the scientific knowledge of this world. Though he lived with a degenerative disease and experienced severe disabilities due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, he was one of the greatest physicists in history. Therefore, no legislation or policy should use the additional challenges related to raising children with disabilities as a justification for laws that fail to respect human dignity and violate international law.
In the following months, the work towards the elaboration of the post-2020 European Disability Strategy will start. It should include reflection on the stigmatisation and discrimination of persons with disabilities through abortion policy. Indeed, what would be a better place to start acting against stereotyping disability as incompatible with a good life than one of the most dangerous places for a disabled person today – his or her mother’s womb.

                The European Parliament on Thursday (3 May) gave an overwhelming majority to a resolution asking the European Commission to play a much bigger role in opposing attempts by member states to limit media freedom and pluralism.
The Resolution on media pluralism and media freedom in the European Union was passed with 488 votes in favour, 43 against and 114 abstentions, thanks to a majority formed by the EPP, S&D, ALDE, GUE/NGL and Green/EFA groups.
The vote coincided with the World Press Freedom Day, and follows the recent slaying of journalists Daphne Caruana Galizia in Malta and Jan Kuciak in Slovakia, as well as by a general worsening of the press freedom across the EU.



The Brief – Press freedom, a candle in the wind
Every year, May 3 should remind us of the fundamental principles of press freedom, and is an occasion to look around and evaluate press freedom in our environment and around the world. 


The Commission so far has had limited prerogatives – and modest ambitions – in terms of media freedom. The responsible commissioner is Mariya Gabriel, but in his Mission letter to her, Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker barely mentioned the issue.
The resolution was introduced by Barbara Spinelli, an Italian left-wing deputy on the Parliament’s Civil Liberties Committee, and pointed out that more than half the cases of abuses against media professionals in Europe are committed by government officials.
Monitoring mechanisms 
MEPs want governments to safeguard and promote a pluralist, independent and free media landscape in the service of democratic society. The resolution also asks the European Commission to introduce human rights impact assessments  of its legislative proposals and to present a proposal for the establishment of an EU mechanism on democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights.
They also call on the Commission to treat attempts by member states’ governments to harm media freedom and pluralism as serious and systemic abuses of power.
Also, MEPs appeal on the Commission to allocate permanent and adequate funding in the EU budget to support the Centre for Media Pluralism and Media Freedom, and to create an annual mechanism for the assessment of the risks to media pluralism in the member states. They also stress that the same mechanism should be applied to measure media pluralism in the candidate countries, with a direct bearing on the progress of the negotiation process.
So far the Commission has played a very limited role in monitoring media freedom in member states, although it has been watching closely the applicant countries.
Further, MEPs calls on the Commission to monitor and collect information and statistics on media freedom and pluralism within all member states, and to closely analyse cases of the infringement of the fundamental rights of journalists.
 
Media concentration
Moreover, the resolution stresses that media ownership remains highly concentrated, and call on the member states to adopt and implement media ownership regulations to avoid concentration of ownership in the media sector, and to guarantee transparency, disclosure, and easy accessibility for citizens to information on media ownership, funding sources and management.
Media concentration has increased rapidly in Bulgaria, the EU country which ranks the lowest in the 2018 World Press Freedom Index (111th out of 180 countries monitored). Reporters Without Borders note that the most notorious embodiment of this aberrant state of affairs is Deylan Peevski, owner of the New Bulgarian Media Group. His group has six newspapers and controls nearly 80% of print media distribution.
Reporters Without Borders note that the government’s allocation of EU funding to certain media outlets is conducted with a complete lack of transparency, and served as tacit encouragements to them to go easy on the government in their reporting or refrain from covering certain problematic stories altogether.
However, the issue of EU funds (often advertising for EU programs or tenders) being channelled by some governments to friendly media was omitted by MEPs from the resolution.

                Almost certainly to the displeasure of mainstream Brussels, leaders of Europe’s far-right parties came together on the French Riviera this week, saying they wanted to devise a battle plan for next year’s European election.
The timing – 1 May, or Labour Day – was no coincidence. Some of the leaders who came to Nice denounced the ‘resurgence of neo-Marxism’ as a threat to Europe.
The far-right anti-immigrant Eurosceptics are a motley crew but the nativist veteran Marine Le Pen has managed to bring East and West together, rallying behind slogans like ‘multiculturalism is failing’ and ‘time to change Europe’.
The rally was organised under the banner of the ENF (Europe of Nations and Freedom), a small faction in the European Parliament.
Still, there were some notable absences that must have made Le Pen grind her teeth in disappointment: Italy’s Lega Nord leader Matteo Salvini was scheduled to appear but only sent a video message of support. Dutch politician Geert Wilders, also stayed away.
But there were plenty of others who took part.
Vesselin Mareshki, leader of Bulgaria’s “Volya” party, which has 11 MPs in the national parliament, was one of them.
A day after returning home, he announced in an interview on the Bulgarian national radio that his force would campaign for a referendum for Bulgaria to leave NATO.
“This will be one of our big initiatives in the campaign for the European elections. We believe that NATO doesn’t actually give us anything, but that it is robbing us instead,” Mareshki said. He added that NATO commitments required Bulgaria to “take several billion from the Bulgarian people” and invest them in “meaningless piles of metal”.
According to Mareshki, EU membership has also been detrimental to the Bulgarian people. “They banned the construction of a new nuclear power plant, they made us shut down our [nuclear] reactors, they did not allow us to participate in South Stream, at the same time they are building Nord Stream, Turkish Stream and all other streams”, he said.
From the Czech Republic came Tomio Okamura, leader of the far-right group SPD (Freedom and Direct Democracy). SPD has already called for the country to quit the EU and has been pushing for a referendum similar to the Brexit vote in the UK in 2016.
Okamura, like Le Pen, is seeking allies for the European elections and aims to build a coalition against what he calls an ‘EU diktat´. He stresses the importance of breaking free from the omnipotent rule of the EU Commission and Brussels affiliates in order to dissolve the EU from within and restructure it into a Union of European states, whilst preserving the four freedoms and interstate cooperation.
In his speech in Nice, Okamura slammed the centrist direction of the EU, headed by Commission President Juncker and the leaders of the Franco-German axis, Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel.
It would be easy to dismiss these comments as marginal if the far-right had not made inroads into mainstream politics in the last few years.
In Germany, the anti-immigration AfD got almost 13% of the vote in September’s election. In Italy, Salvini’s Lega won the most seats in the inconclusive March ballot. Leaders of Poland and Hungary declare themselves as centre-right but share many anti-immigrant and Eurosceptic views with ENF parties.
The pro-European camp should take heart from the fact that none of them came to Nice but there is no room for complacency. It remains to be seen if Europe’s economic recovery, the end of roaming and free Interrail passes for the young will be enough to stave off the challenge and keep the next European Parliament firmly in the hands of pro-European forces.

Inside Track

Booze move. After years of legal blocks, Scotland introduced minimum pricing for alcohol. Meanwhile, the whisky industry, which is lucrative to the country’s economy, worries that this will mean losses.
Back to the game? In France, Marine Le Pen led a rally of Europe’s far-right to celebrate recent gains on the continent and devise a battle plan for next year’s European elections.
Overcoming fears. Poland has not accepted any refugees under the EU’s relocation and resettlement programme. A new project tries to overcome stereotypes.
Ending limbo? Raising hopes for an end to months of political instability, the Czech Republic could be days away from getting a new coalition government.
Under fire. A Slovak public broadcaster came under attack after sacking four reporters who had signed an open letter warning of creeping political pressure in state media.
Ridesharing. As Europe looks for models to facilitate a peaceful coexistence between taxi drivers and new ride-sharing platforms, Estonia offers a neat solution.
Not amused. Bulgaria dislikes the major innovation in the next long-term EU budget proposed by the European Commission to link EU funding to rule of law.
Deep wounds. Italy is facing the challenge to overcome deep-rooted hostility built up over years as the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the centre-left Democratic Party are to strike a deal to form a government and end the post-election stalemate.
Taking initiative. Spain wants to become the next major player defending European shores as Europe’s naval power Britain is at the EU’s exit door.
Strengthening ties. According to a new poll, most Swiss support the government’s plan to forge a new treaty with the EU that would have arbitration panels to help settle disputes.
Welcoming efforts. If Macedonia’s efforts to resolve a decades-old name dispute with Greece come to a positive result, the Balkan country has the prospect of joining the EU and NATO.

                The European Union needs to stand up for environmental democracy and provide access to justice – to ensure respect for the rule of law, to maintain its environmental leadership, and to restore its legitimacy, warns Anaïs Berthier.
Anaïs Berthier leads the Environmental democracy project at ClientEarth, a group of activist lawyers committed to secure a healthy planet.
This summer marks the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Aarhus Convention, the UN’s flagship treaty on environmental democracy.
Under this convention, citizens and NGOs were finally granted procedural rights to have their say in ensuring our environment is protected. Namely the convention ensures rights to access information, participation in decision-making processes, and access to justice – the right to challenge the decisions of public authorities in court.
The philosophy underpinning the convention is based on the – still very modern – idea that we cannot rely on governments and experts alone to address environmental damage resulting from violations of the law. From climate change to biodiversity loss to pervasive pollutants, environmental challenges are multidimensional and civil society has to the able to have its say in tackling these issues.
After being a major force behind the convention’s ratification, the EU should lead by example and be a champion of the convention and the rights and values enshrined within. This should occur not just across the EU but in state parties from Central Europe and Asia to support the march towards democratisation sparked and afforded by the convention.
Lack of access to justice at EU level
Unfortunately, the EU’s commitment to the Convention and participatory democracy, which it promotes, has recently been seriously called into question.
Last year, the independent UN compliance committee of the Aarhus Convention found the EU in breach of the Convention due to insufficient opportunities for the public to have access to justice at the institutional level of the EU.
It followed a complaint lodged by ClientEarth in 2008 contesting the fact that individuals and NGOs were not granted legal standing to challenge decisions adopted by EU institutions before the Court of Justice of the EU.
As yet, no individuals or NGOs have been able to challenge any decisions of EU institutions, except the ones refusing to disclose documents.
What this means is that while industry is allowed to challenge decisions that impact their economic and financial interests, the public’s interest, around environmental protection and public health, are left unrepresented. EU decisions allowing member states to exceed air pollution limits; to authorise pesticides, to kill protected species or allow state subsidies of nuclear or coal power plants, cannot be challenged in front of EU courts, despite those decisions having disastrous impacts for the environment and everyday life of EU citizens.
Disappointingly, the EU’s reaction so far has been to oppose the endorsement of the UN committee’s findings by the Meeting of the Parties (MoP) last September– a first in the history of the convention and a severe undermining of the convention’s compliance mechanisms.
Nevertheless, the EU has committed to explore ways and means to comply with the convention. However, seven months later, we see no sign of the EU taking steps to address the roots of this non-compliance problem.



EU slapped for breaching Aarhus Convention on access to environmental justice
The European Union has accepted a UN ruling that found the bloc in breach of international laws requiring the general public to have access to justice on environmental matters, a decision applauded by green activists.


A crossroad moment for EU democracy
Where do we go from here? Currently at the crossroads, the EU should see this decision as an opportunity and not as a threat. Opportunity not only to comply with international law but also taking steps to restore its legitimacy at a time European citizens have never felt so remote from their Union’s institutions and Euroscepticism running high.
Yet there has been an apparent unwillingness for the commission to properly address the issue. After the compliance committee clearly recommended an amendment to the Aarhus Regulation, the commission has fallen short with a proposal to just carry out a study to assess the situation. It’s now up to member states to step up and make their EU institutions truly accountable on environmental matters.
The Council of the EU is considering making the unprecedented move in environmental matters of using a provision of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (Article 241), which will allow it to request the Commission come forward with a legislative proposal for revising the so-called Aarhus Regulation.
If made, this request will mark a real shift in the use of EU institutional powers, which have until now consisted of the Commission acting as the “Guardian of the Treaty” and of EU law in general – with the Aarhus Convention being an integral part of EU law.
It seems this is a case of the Commission having a ‘do as I say, not as I do’ attitude, as it demands member states comply with international law while exempting itself. The resulting backlash from member states will hopefully lead to the Council using Article 241 of the Treaty, and remind the Commission that, along with member states, it is also subject to the law.
Revising the Aarhus Regulation is the only measure the Commission and the Council may adopt to bring the EU back into compliance with the Convention. This will provide members of the public with their right to access to justice, and to enforce EU’s environmental laws and better ensure environmental protections.
It would also restore some credibility for the EU and its institutions. A proper commitment to the rule of law will demonstrate concrete progress in time for the 20th anniversary of the Aarhus Convention and before important European elections.
            ","The European Union needs to stand up for environmental democracy and provide access to justice – to ensure respect for the rule of law, to maintain its environmental leadership, and to restore its legitimacy, warns Anaïs Berthier. Anaïs Berthier leads the Environmental democracy project at ClientEarth, a group of activist lawyers committed to secure a healthy planet. This summer marks the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Aarhus Convention, the UN’s flagship treaty on environmental democracy. Under this convention, citizens and NGOs were finally granted procedural rights to have their say in ensuring our environment is protected. Namely the convention ensures rights to access information, participation in decision-making processes, and access to justice – the right to challenge the decisions of public authorities in court. The philosophy underpinning the convention is based on the – still very modern – idea that we cannot rely on governments and experts alone to address environmental damage resulting from violations of the law. From climate change to biodiversity loss to pervasive pollutants, environmental challenges are multidimensional and civil society has to the able to have its say in tackling these issues. After being a major force behind the convention’s ratification, the EU should lead by example and be a champion of the convention and the rights and values enshrined within. This should occur not just across the EU but in state parties from Central Europe and Asia to support the march towards democratisation sparked and afforded by the convention. Lack of access to justice at EU level Unfortunately, the EU’s commitment to the Convention and participatory democracy, which it promotes, has recently been seriously called into question. Last year, the independent UN compliance committee of the Aarhus Convention found the EU in breach of the Convention due to insufficient opportunities for the public to have access to justice at the institutional level of the EU. It followed a complaint lodged by ClientEarth in 2008 contesting the fact that individuals and NGOs were not granted legal standing to challenge decisions adopted by EU institutions before the Court of Justice of the EU. As yet, no individuals or NGOs have been able to challenge any decisions of EU institutions, except the ones refusing to disclose documents. What this means is that while industry is allowed to challenge decisions that impact their economic and financial interests, the public’s interest, around environmental protection and public health, are left unrepresented. EU decisions allowing member states to exceed air pollution limits; to authorise pesticides, to kill protected species or allow state subsidies of nuclear or coal power plants, cannot be challenged in front of EU courts, despite those decisions having disastrous impacts for the environment and everyday life of EU citizens. Disappointingly, the EU’s reaction so far has been to oppose the endorsement of the UN committee’s findings by the Meeting of the Parties (MoP) last September– a first in the history of the convention and a severe undermining of the convention’s compliance mechanisms. Nevertheless, the EU has committed to explore ways and means to comply with the convention. However, seven months later, we see no sign of the EU taking steps to address the roots of this non-compliance problem. EU slapped for breaching Aarhus Convention on access to environmental justice The European Union has accepted a UN ruling that found the bloc in breach of international laws requiring the general public to have access to justice on environmental matters, a decision applauded by green activists. A crossroad moment for EU democracy Where do we go from here? Currently at the crossroads, the EU should see this decision as an opportunity and not as a threat.

                This article is part of our special report Social Europe: Bringing back democracy at work on the EU political agenda.An improved EU legislation that boosts workers’ information, consultation and participation rights will push social matters higher up on the EU political agenda, according to the participants of a symposium about workers held in Brussels on 26-27 April. 
“There is a really intensive year for workers’ rights that lies ahead of us and we are in the middle of it,” MEP Evelyn Regner told the symposium, hosted by the Hans Böckler Foundation and the EU Trade Union Institute (ETUI). The event was dedicated to strengthening workers’ voice.
‘Workers’ voice’ refers to information, consultation, participation and co-determination rights in the workplace, in companies and in company supervisory and administrative boards.
Currently, workers representative have the right to seat in a company boardroom in 18 out of the 28 EU member states as well as in Norway.
“2018 is particularly important because it is the last chance to really deliver on workers’ rights before the next European elections are held and the mandate of the European Commission expires [both in 2019],” Regner explained. 
At stake, she explained, is “building a stronger social safety net we are entitled to expect from the European Union”.
“A ‘Europe that protects’ is a nice motto. But it is not only about physical security and police reinforcement we are talking about. We are also talking about social safety. The two, security and social safety, go hand in hand. And citizens expect the EU to deliver on this issue,” she said.
Given the current defiance of EU citizens towards European institutions, this might seem quite a challenging task. 
This is why MEP and socialist leader Udo Bullmann called for action: “People want to see us fight. Only then will they identify with us, and only then can we really make a difference”.



EU must offer 'an agenda of hope', says Socialist leader Bullmann
There is no alternative to the European Union, but it needs to offer an ‘agenda of hope’ to Europeans, Udo Bullmann, MEP, the new leader of the Socialist and Democrat group, said in an interview with EURACTIV.  


What is the issue?
“All opinion polls show that having a secured job, a good education and social fairness are the most important issues for European citizens”, said Maria Jepsen from the European Trade Union Institute.
Yet, the European project has largely been focusing on economic development and on the EU internal market’s legal framing to the detriment of the social dimension, underlined Peter Scherrer, European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) Deputy General Secretary.
“A fair single market must deliver for both workers and businesses, not only for companies. Social and economic issues must be on equal footing, and more progress towards democracy at work is urgently needed,” he said. 
Which is why workers’ participation and democracy at work should be put high on the European political agenda, much higher than it currently is, insisted Norbert Kluge, from the Hans Böckler Foundation. 
But the challenge is big. 
Anke Hassel from the Institute of Economic and Social Research within the Hans Böckler Foundation released new findings at the event, showing how powerful transnational companies have become. 
“In 2015, 69 out of 100 largest economic entities were companies. Walmart has higher revenues than the government of Spain and Apple has higher revenues than the government of Belgium,” she said. 
“Transnational companies have long become major political and economic actors in Europe and beyond,” she continued, adding that the decisions the top managers of these companies are taking have a powerful impact on local communities and governments’ tax base, as well as on social and environmental standards.
This is due to the entry of China, India and the former communist countries into the global trading system in the early 1990s, a move that has boosted globalisation extensively and contributed to the financialisation of the economy, she explained. 
“Transnational companies shape globalisation. If globalisation is to be made fairer, transnational companies have to be better regulated and embedded into the societies where they operate,” Hassel observed, adding that as a consequence, a better corporate governance fostering sustainable companies has to become a stronger concern amid European trade unions and other stakeholders. 
Fostering tax justice
In that regard, the European Commission has made a move in the right direction with the release on 25 April of its proposals for new company law rules, participants said.
But there is much room for improvement, they warned.
ETUC’s Peter Scherrer said at a first glance the proposals on cross-border conversions seem to show a welcome change of direction in EU company law, “which until now has facilitated deregulation and regime shopping”. 
“The Commission aims to ensure that a company has genuine economic activity in the member state where it wants to relocate its registered office. The proposed Directive therefore offers a basis for discussion, meaning there is definitely space for improvement,” Scherrer said.
“What is of very much importance to us, is that we get into the process where we can introduce amendments, where we can change the proposals. Some people say the glass is half full or half empty. I would say the glass is 1/3 full at the moment”, he said. 



European Dialogue 2018: Social Europe Strengthening Workers' Voice
The worker’s voice is part of a democratic Europe. Securing and strengthening it is supposed to increase the acceptance of the EU.


The new proposals tackle the companies’ mobility issue, that is, the possibility for a company to move to another member state without losing its legal personality or having to liquidate or renegotiate their business contracts beforehand.
The trade unions have been warning that if not properly regulated, this might result in abuse and unfair competition through artificial arrangements – for example via letterbox companies – in order for companies to avoid paying taxes, social contributions and comply with workers’ rights.
“We are trying hard to prevent the use of letterbox companies”, said Renate Nikolay, from the DG Justice at the European Commission but added:
“We have rules on cross-border mergers, but no regulation on cross-border divisions or cross-border conversions.”
“So what we are offering with the new proposals is a balanced approach which enables businesses to take advantage of the single market while attaching to it a large number of safeguards beneficial to workers”, Renate Nikolay said. 
Codetermination, a boost for the economy 
In the context of member state competing against one another on tax issues, Norbert Kluge from the Hans Böckler Foundation said Europe needs a new understanding of what competition really means. 
And pushing codetermination at the EU level is the way forward because it levels down the race to the bottom in tax avoidance and non-completion of workers’ rights between member states, he added. 
Codetermination is a specific regulation related to workers’ rights and representation at companies’ supervisory boards. It is also a characteristic of Germany’s social and labour legislation. 
The Hans Böckler Foundation explained that codetermination in Germany defines a set of rights that give employees the possibility of actively participating in the shaping of their working environment. 
This includes legally stipulated company-internal agreements devised in conjunction with union contracts as well as informal determination possibilities that have arisen from codetermination practice.
The European Court of Justice has ruled that German codetermination conforms to EU law.
“Workers‘ participation and codetermination are not an obstacle to a productive and profitable economy, on the contrary, codetermination is an asset for EU countries,” Norbert Kluge continued, citing the findings released by Anke Hassel. «The active participation of workers and their representatives not only contributes to employment stability but also boost the economy».
The study she conducted shows that member states like Sweden, Denmark, Germany and Austria, with strong workers’ participation rights in companies and in administrations, have the best economic performances.
But the trade union community finds that workers’ participation in the companies is still kept at a low level across the EU.
“We need better and more efficient control instruments to strengthen codetermination and workers’ participation rights in Europe. There is much to do in the coming months,” Peter Scherrer said.

                This article is part of our special report Social Europe: Bringing back democracy at work on the EU political agenda.A vital social democracy will play a decisive role in shaping the future of the European Union. The goal of a united Europe, contractually agreed by all EU member states, is to promote participatory democracy, writes Norbert Kluge.
Norbert Kluge is the director of the Institute for co-determination and corporate governance of the Hans Boeckler Foundation.
The fundamental right to information and consultation makes workers in Europe also citizens in the workplace (Article 27 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights as part of the EU Treaties).
In places where nobody knows the future of work and business in the digital age, the external framework conditions have to create an eye-to-eye-level between those involved in the economy.
The right to participate in the fair design of the social market economy will shape the future of Europe. Otherwise, employers will be tailoring flexibility in their own interests, while European workers will be required to give their last shirt off their back for it.
Social Europe is a long way off because the dynamic of growing social inequality remains unbroken. Large transnational companies are regarded as accelerators of the dynamics of injustice.
They “optimise” nation-state laws and obligations of all kinds (taxation, consumer protection, environmental protection, liability, co-determination, “money laundering”) via so-called company engineering. And no new binding frameworks imposed on them are in sight at international level.
On the contrary, experience shows that companies skilfully and regularly avoid the binding representation of employees’ interests. Such practices must be put on a socio-political leash.
Co-determination, as practised successfully in large companies based in Germany until today, is a good reference for how it can be done the other way. But not only in Germany, the participation of employees at the top of companies works.
In 18 out of 28 EU member states, employees have a statutory right to say and can vote on boards or supervisory boards, our research shows. This kind of “worker’s voice” creates better working conditions – and it is also one of the few hurdles left today that prevents companies from being wholly exposed to the return of financial investors interests.
Sustainable companies need well-qualified workers. This is their international competitive advantage, as shown by their economic success worldwide. But workers want future-proof jobs and locations in Europe; this integrates companies in Europe in social terms as well.
“Worker’s Voice” at the top of companies makes them internationally unique and competitive. Social cohesion (as measured by the so-called GINI coefficient) is the highest in those EU member states where various elements of worker participation such as union loyalty, high coverage through collective agreements, strong employee rights at company level and employee participation have a positive impact on each other.
This has been demonstrated for years by the Worker’s Participation Index, which is prepared annually by the ETUI for the “Benchmarking Working Europe Report.”
There are therefore good and realistic reasons to include co-determination as a standard in European company law. This standard needs to be part of every electoral programme of all democratic and pro-European parties that are to compete in the European parliamentary elections in spring 2019.
We must succeed in bringing the topic into the work programme of the next European Commission after the spring 2019 European elections. If we do not succeed, it will hardly play a role in the next five years. Another step backwards for Social Europe is looming!
The European Dialogue 2018, organised by the Hans-Böckler-Foundation and the European Trade Union Institute (ETUI), marks the beginning of a new debate on European participation. The task of national and European policy must therefore be to enrich the rules of the internal market with workers’ rights to information, consultation and participation in company decisions.
It is the unanimous objective of the unions in the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) to introduce minimum standards in European company law. National differences can be described as “functional equivalents” and thus become comparable in their effects. Thus, management decisions can be related to a social discourse.
National differences in industrial relations can be accepted without being institutionally adapted at cross-border level. The Böckler Foundation’s expert group “Worker’s Voice in European Corporate Governance” introduced this new approach to the discussion on the occasion of the European Discussion 2018.
There are increasing signs that this approach is heard in European politics.
With its Company Mobility Package, the European Commission wants to make the potential of digitalisation for cross-border corporate mobility in the EU internal market easier to exploit. Today’s unregulated relocation of companies‘ headquarters across European borders should thus be given a legal framework.
The European Commission wants companies to account for the economic reasons that motivated them to change under company law. In particular, the company will report on how this decision will affect employment and co-determination.
We will measure the suitability of the proposals primarily by whether it is possible to put a stop to the dreadful situation of transforming operating companies into pure letterbox companies in inner-European tax havens.
Unfortunately, the Commission has with its legislative proposal failed to introduce a European minimum standard for co-determination into European company law.
Nonetheless, the proposal shows that it is concerned about the protection of workers’ rights. For example, there are several regulations to safeguard previously existing employee rights for a limited period of time. According to initial trade union assessments, this attempt is not sufficient, though.
However, this is no reason for rejection because in the subsequent legislative procedure, especially in the EU Parliament, there is room and opportunity for improvement.
The EU Company Mobility Package will definitely not provide special protection for German co-determination. Instead of applying legal regulations, the involvement of employees at the top of the company would have to be renegotiated on a case-by-case basis, as is already the case for European Companies (Societas Europea, SE).
However, it can be seen today how companies are evading German co-determination and the application of European law. Therefore, in order to maintain co-determination in Germany, German politicians must first of all do their own homework.
Even though the proposal from Brussels includes a range of measures, Europe now must show that it wants to be more than a mere single market. “Worker’s Voice for Good Corporate Governance” works socio-politically as driver of active social inclusion and welfare statehood.
The EU internal market does not just belong to capital owners, institutional investors and entrepreneurs. We need a paradigm shift in European company law:
Companies and their investors must be legally bound to build long-term and sustainable prospects, with a future for jobs, locations and the environment – in order to be internationally competitive. That is the point!

The EU Company Mobility Package will definitely not provide special protection for German co-determination. Instead of applying legal regulations, the involvement of employees at the top of the company would have to be renegotiated on a case-by-case basis, as is already the case for European Companies (Societas Europea, SE). However, it can be seen today how companies are evading German co-determination and the application of European law. Therefore, in order to maintain co-determination in Germany, German politicians must first of all do their own homework. Even though the proposal from Brussels includes a range of measures, Europe now must show that it wants to be more than a mere single market. “Worker’s Voice for Good Corporate Governance” works socio-politically as driver of active social inclusion and welfare statehood. The EU internal market does not just belong to capital owners, institutional investors and entrepreneurs. We need a paradigm shift in European company law: Companies and their investors must be legally bound to build long-term and sustainable prospects, with a future for jobs, locations and the environment – in order to be internationally competitive. That is the point!",175

                Let’s involve more people in decision making and inspire all levels of government, be they local, national or European, to put people first, writes Anna Lisa Boni.
Anna Lisa Boni is the secretary general of EUROCITIES, the network of major European cities. It’s new pan-European campaign, Cities4Europe, aims to explore new forms of democracy for all levels of government.
It’s time to change the way things are done in Europe. Creating a society fit for the 21st century should mean more people having a say in decision making. This needs to go beyond merely voting in elections and towards an active, more engaged, direct democracy.
The current system of voting every few years and allowing representatives to do their best, or worst, until we have another say a few years down the line does not reflect the way we live, and the technology we carry around with us in our daily lives.
Let’s involve more people in decision making and inspire all levels of government to put people first.
A modern society, and especially an urban society, is on the go 24/7, and our politics should reflect this. Many city administrations are experimenting with online democracy platforms. Athens’ SynAthina, and Madrid’s Decide Madrid, allow citizens a direct say in decision making. As such, people become more involved and take more responsibility and ownership of outcomes.
Other examples of cities working with local populations to reach consensus-based decision making include participative budgeting. Several cities, such as Paris, are allocating a proportion of their investment budget to be spent according to the will of the people.
These are new models for democracy that require a new way of thinking for policymakers. It’s working in many cities because of their size – cities provide great test beds for innovation.
Brussels is actively including citizens in a number of ways, such as in its approach to the circular economy, which it designed together with local citizens, businesses and others. The Brussels-Capital Region also set up an online platform (Good Food Brussels) to map out and share news of existing sustainable food initiatives and inspire others to take part.
At EUROCITIES we want to collect inspiring examples like these and generate new, positive ideas to create a future that works better for all people. We’re starting this month via the launch of our campaign ‘Cities4Europe – Europe for citizens’, which will hold events in cities all across our continent.
In this spirit, Leeuwarden in the Netherlands will be hosting cultural performances, including a theatre production that shares stories and thoughts from local people, and will invite speakers, experts, troublemakers, artists and experts from all over Europe to debate our future.
Ghent has asked all its citizens to share their ideas for a better Europe. It will also hold a climate festival to talk about the need to create a climate-neutral city and will put young voters directly in touch with local politicians through debates, lectures and workshop.
Gijon, Genoa and Lodz plan public debates. Meanwhile, Rennes will gather a community of local citizens and international stakeholders in a creative workshop to consider new initiatives that could be implemented by cities to promote European citizenship.
Later in the year Nantes metropole and the city of Nantes will bring together a group of 60 or so young people to present a concrete initiative designed to reinforce citizenship and the notion of ‘living together’ in their city.
Over the coming months, we will bring these ideas together and develop our top recommendations to be shared with national and European leaders. It’s a critical time for Europe, with both the UK’s planned exit from the European Union and the next European elections on the horizon.
We want to make sure as many people’s voices as possible are heard at this time, so that the future of Europe better reflects our common values and commitments.
It’s time to start doing things differently in Europe and that starts by listening to more and different people!

                S&D President Udo Bullmann called on “progressive” political forces in Greece to join forces as the “way to the country’s future” and to keep distance from EPP-affiliated New Democracy, which he said has a big responsibility in the Greek financial crisis.
“I’m not a player in domestic politics in Greece. But as a European Social Democrat, I cannot see any improvement if the government would switch toward New Democracy which has a major responsibility for running the country into chaos,” S&D chief told EURACTIV, adding that this would not be a good option for the future.
EURACTIV asked Bullmann how he would see a progressive coalition in the country between the leftist Syriza, socialist Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) and the centrist Potami.
S&D-affiliated Pasok has been on power as well and also bears responsibility for the financial crisis. It went from being the largest party in 2009 with 44% of the vote to 4.7% in 2015.
Bullmann answered that the way to the future lies in a progressive government with progressive ideas.
“I would rather recommend that the way to the future should be the progressives making mutual use of their experiences of what went wrong and what well and join their forces to have a progressive idea of how to develop this wonderful country to the best fortune of their wonderful people,” the German Social Democrat emphasised.
Pasok and Potami are already party members of S&D while Syriza is part of the leftist GUE-NGL group. However, Greek Premier Alexis Tsipras has close ties with the European Socialist leaders, who publicly backed the country during the crisis, and he is regularly invited as an observer at their summits.
The country is expected to exit the bailout after eight years of austerity-driven policies and the discussion about the future political landscape has heated up in Athens.
Pasok and Potami recently formed the “Movement for Change”, which aims at representing the center-left pole in Greek politics. Once a key player in Greek politics, Potami (The Riover) was founded in 2014 and obtained 6.1% in the 2015 vote.
Pasok politicians are divided over a potential cooperation with Syriza. Some oppose aligning with Syriza and are closer to New Democracy while others openly back future cooperation.
For instance, Yannis Ragousis, a former Pasok minister and candidate for the presidency of the “Movement for Change”, pleaded for cooperation with Syriza as a matter of life and death.
“As a Movement for Change, we will return to the progressive structure and be born again, or we will die forever. Any new government cooperation with New Democracy will betray the progressive movement and be a proof of dependence on the oligarchy, with which New Democracy is identified,” Ragousis hammered out.
There are also divisions regarding the date of the national election.
The largest opposition force New Democracy calls for an early election and Pasok’s leader Fofi Gennimata is on the same line. On the other hand, Potami leader Stavros Theodorakis is against such a scenario, claiming that the government should end its mandate which normally expires in October 2019.
In the meantime, Syriza made it clear it plans to complete its 4-year mandate and would be open to cooperation with other parties, although it was still too early to say which.
Syriza sources told EURACTIV that the party was open to any cooperation with democratic forces that promote similar projects for the benefit of the country, even on an ad hoc basis like for the constitutional review.
“But it is too early to say anything else,” the sources added.
The same sources explained that as a first condition Pasok needs to make it plain that its cooperation with New Democracy belongs to the past as well as the neoliberal austerity policies the two forces jointly promoted “against the Greek people”.
“And of course, Pasok needs to realise that the cooperation with both Syriza and New Democracy is not possible,” the Syriza sources underlined.
Fair reforms for a new economy
Bullmann also expressed his optimism about Greece’s exit from the bailout saying that this issue is dear to his heart.
“I have been following the Greek case from the very beginning and I have always been too critical of the abuse of power of the elites in Greece to betray their people […] but I was similarly critical against the Troika about missing the point,” he noted.
The German SPD politician claimed that Troika, a “non-legitimised and non-democratic entity”, forced things in the programme to be applied on Greek people.
“These things were not justified and were not tackling the real problems.”
“Why not insisting on a tax reform? Why not insisting on the rich people paying appropriate taxes? Why the condition is always cutting pensions, wages, and after realise that the economy was getting into trouble because people did not have the purchasing power anymore? This concept is not realistic for me,” Bullmann emphasised.
He also strongly criticised the German former finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) and accused him of irresponsibility and “analphabetism” regarding the situation in Greece.
“I could never understand why a German finance minister, who is really knowledgeable about Europe, saying in 2015 ‘please get out of the euro’ risking the total collapse of the economy and the society.”
Contrary to the positions of the CDU politician in the most dramatic episodes of the Greek crisis, German social democrats have insisted that Greece should stay in the euro.



German foreign minister: Greece should stay in eurozone
Germany should do all it can to keep Greece in the eurozone, German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said in an interview on Tuesday (21 February), amid renewed tensions between Athens and its international creditors over its bailout programme.


Bullmann added that there are still a lot of things to be done in Greece and he insisted on fair reforms, which would not cut further the income of poor families.
“I am talking about fair structural reforms in the sense of a fair and just society […] reforms that give a progressive momentum for a new economy,” he concluded.

                Barely a week after the last-minute drama of will-he-won’t-he scrap the tariffs on steel, the EU is once again waiting with bated breath to see whether Donald Trump will dial up tensions in the uneasy transatlantic relationship.
This time, the volatile US president might dismantle the Iran nuclear deal.
The dramatic drumroll before a Trump decision with potentially disastrous global effects is getting familiar. Remember when he pulled the US out of the Paris climate agreement?
White smoke, in the form of his announcement, is expected at around 20:00 central European time.
The EU is in waiting mode, with many wondering if it has a Plan B in place. Its foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini will make an official comment from Rome right after Trump’s announcement.
After 12 years of uncertainty and two years of tense negotiations, the Iran nuclear deal was concluded in Vienna in July 2015, reassuring the world that the country’s nuclear programme would not seek to develop nuclear weapons. Sanctions were gradually lifted and international monitoring put in place.
Six major power were involved: the US, China, Russia and three EU members, France, the UK and Germany.
When Trump took over, he made clear he viewed the deal as “disastrous” and full of flaws and would seek to scrap it. This is an election year in the US, and the “America first” president has to answer to a support base that views the deal as a toxic Obama-era mistake.
All the other five countries that are part of the agreement are in favour of extending it, including the UK, whose Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson tried and failed (just like Macron and Merkel) to persuade Trump to stay on board.
Hours before Trump’s expected announcement, a European Commission spokesperson repeated on Tuesday the EU’s standard line that the Iran deal has proven to be effective and needs to stay in place.
The EU is “working on plans to protect European companies”, the spokesperson declared but would not offer any more detail on what the contingency plan is if Trump pulls the plug on the agreement.
The effects of the US leaving the agreement could be dramatic, and trigger political and economic uncertainty between the US, Europe and Iran. It could usher in a new era where Europe is forced to clean up Trump’s mess. Not least, it could also trigger a hike in global oil prices.
Later tonight, Trump will be in the spotlight. After him, Europe might be in the hotseat.
The Roundup
In a hall once used to crown czars, Vladimir Putin was inaugurated as Russian president for the fourth time today. In total, he has been in charge of Russia for 18 years now, either as president or prime minister, swapping places with Dmitri Medvedev due to constitutional inconvenience.
Expect another bumpy day, as President Trump is due to announce whether the US will pull out of the Iran nuclear deal or stay in and work with European allies.
Gas swaps in which Iran plays a central role could open the door for Turkmenistan to become an important player on the EU gas market.  Also in the region, Armenia installed an opposition leader as interim prime minister, after weeks of peaceful popular protests. Sam Morgan reports from the scene.
Ahead of the June summit, member states are wrestling over how to reform their broken migration and asylum system.
Three years after its establishment, a new prosecutor was named at the Specialist Chamber in The Hague, which is examining war crimes against ethnic Serbs in Kosovo. First indictments are expected to be issued soon.

                The idea seems logical as legislatives changes adopted in Hungary and Poland are worrisome. But will the EU funding conditionality tackle the root of the problem? Ramona Coman and Nathalie Brack have a standpoint.
Ramona Coman is the director of the Institute for European Studies, Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB). Nathalie Brack is a professor in political science at ULB. 
On 2 May, the European Commission presented a broad overview of its budget proposal for the post-Brexit era (2021-2027) to the European Parliament. Several issues caught the media’s attention, amongst which the audacious proposal to condition EU funding on the respect of the rule of law.
This proposal arose as a consequence of the fruitless political dialogue about the rule of law that the Commission has engaged in with the Polish government these past few years.
For the Commission, which has shown great creativity since 2010 by setting up various tools before triggering Article 7, this new form of conditionality could be a more efficient tool than, for example, the new rule of law setting created in 2014.
The new proposal to condition the allocation of funds on the rule of law enjoys significant political support in France, Germany and the Netherlands. Unsurprisingly, even though Juncker has specified that he wasn’t targeting any country in particular, this proposal has been condemned by the parties in power in various Central and Eastern European states such as Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland or Romania.
The legislative changes adopted in Hungary and Poland in the past few years are worrisome and require careful consideration at the European level.
Indeed, if they have been adopted by democratically elected and highly legitimate governments, they certainly do not reflect the mutual trust that member states need and upon which European integration relies.
It is therefore not surprising that these domestic changes have triggered various reactions from the Commission, which has tried to have a constructive and productive dialogue with the Polish government. But without much success, as Frans Timmermans, the Commission vice-president, repeatedly stressed before the European Parliament.
It only seems logical that this has caused the Commission to search for additional pressure tactics. The idea of conditioning the allocation of funds with respect for the values of the EU could be justified by the fact that the funds are supposed to contribute to the realisation of the goals and values of the EU.
How, then, could funds be allocated to a government which rejects the very idea of a multicultural Europe and wishes its country “to remain the way it was 1100 years ago”? Shouldn’t the funds be suspended if they feed corruption or if they are distributed based on national political considerations?
Yes, but… will this form of conditionality tackle the root of the problem? This seems rather doubtful, and for several reasons.
The first one relates to the decision-making process of such measure, as the Commission’s proposal must be passed by the Council and the Parliament.
Historically, states are very reluctant towards any type of strengthening of the Commission as a political institution.
Those who followed the 2013 debate on the structural funds reform will still remember that the adoption of the macroeconomic conditionality had only been added to the 1303/2013 regulation after long negotiations between the Council and the European Parliament because the latter was mainly against this Commission’s proposal supported by France and Germany.
It can, therefore, be expected that the conditionality based on the rule of law will also require long political negotiations, and without any guarantee of success.
Second, the sanctions themselves would require the building of majorities and alliances, which would again delay the impact of these measures but could also make the debates meaningless if it takes too much time.
Finally, this new form of conditionality could enter into force by 2021. In 2021, Viktor Orbán will probably be campaigning for his fourth mandate. Until then, he will have had the time and legitimacy to make in-depth and quasi-irreversible changes to the nature of the Hungarian political regime (as he himself announced after his election on the 8th of April).
Is it wise to wait until 2021 to take action? How can the Union work with states whose governments try to legitimise the establishment of an illiberal democracy? The lack of reaction on the part of the EU toward the Hungarian and Polish reforms has incidentally given rise to many backlashes, thereby putting the legitimacy of the Union in question.
Let’s not forget that the sanctions will penalize the citizens and regions of the unruly states, and it’s precisely those citizens and regions that need support (notably through EU funding).
Although proposal seems like a good idea at first sight, the Commission should be more ambitious and, more importantly, more innovative in order to counter the democratic drawback of certain states.
It could already start by using the existing tools (such as OLAF) to make sure the EU funds reach the citizens. A special fund for the promotion of the EU’s values and of the rule of law in the new financial planning of the EU could prove interesting.
All the while keeping in mind that multiplying the number of tools risks making the decision-making process more complex and cumbersome, but also, more importantly, jeopardising the EU’s credibility.
            ","The idea seems logical as legislatives changes adopted in Hungary and Poland are worrisome. But will the EU funding conditionality tackle the root of the problem? Ramona Coman and Nathalie Brack have a standpoint. Ramona Coman is the director of the Institute for European Studies, Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB). Nathalie Brack is a professor in political science at ULB. On 2 May, the European Commission presented a broad overview of its budget proposal for the post-Brexit era (2021-2027) to the European Parliament. Several issues caught the media’s attention, amongst which the audacious proposal to condition EU funding on the respect of the rule of law. This proposal arose as a consequence of the fruitless political dialogue about the rule of law that the Commission has engaged in with the Polish government these past few years. For the Commission, which has shown great creativity since 2010 by setting up various tools before triggering Article 7, this new form of conditionality could be a more efficient tool than, for example, the new rule of law setting created in 2014. The new proposal to condition the allocation of funds on the rule of law enjoys significant political support in France, Germany and the Netherlands. Unsurprisingly, even though Juncker has specified that he wasn’t targeting any country in particular, this proposal has been condemned by the parties in power in various Central and Eastern European states such as Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland or Romania. The legislative changes adopted in Hungary and Poland in the past few years are worrisome and require careful consideration at the European level. Indeed, if they have been adopted by democratically elected and highly legitimate governments, they certainly do not reflect the mutual trust that member states need and upon which European integration relies. It is therefore not surprising that these domestic changes have triggered various reactions from the Commission, which has tried to have a constructive and productive dialogue with the Polish government. But without much success, as Frans Timmermans, the Commission vice-president, repeatedly stressed before the European Parliament. It only seems logical that this has caused the Commission to search for additional pressure tactics. The idea of conditioning the allocation of funds with respect for the values of the EU could be justified by the fact that the funds are supposed to contribute to the realisation of the goals and values of the EU. How, then, could funds be allocated to a government which rejects the very idea of a multicultural Europe and wishes its country “to remain the way it was 1100 years ago”? Shouldn’t the funds be suspended if they feed corruption or if they are distributed based on national political considerations? Yes, but… will this form of conditionality tackle the root of the problem? This seems rather doubtful, and for several reasons. The first one relates to the decision-making process of such measure, as the Commission’s proposal must be passed by the Council and the Parliament. Historically, states are very reluctant towards any type of strengthening of the Commission as a political institution. Those who followed the 2013 debate on the structural funds reform will still remember that the adoption of the macroeconomic conditionality had only been added to the 1303/2013 regulation after long negotiations between the Council and the European Parliament because the latter was mainly against this Commission’s proposal supported by France and Germany. It can, therefore, be expected that the conditionality based on the rule of law will also require long political negotiations, and without any guarantee of success.

                An attacker shot an investigative reporter in Montenegro Tuesday (8 May), police said, prompting calls from the European Union and the United States to protect journalists in the Balkan country.
Olivera Lakić “has a bullet wound in her right leg but her life is not in danger,” the police chief Vesko Damjanović told reporters.
Her editor, Mihajlo Jovović, of the influential daily Vijesti, said Lakić was approached by a man outside her home in Podgorica late on Tuesday and “shot in the leg, while she saw two other men running away”.
“I am speechless. Until when will this happen in Montenegro?,” Jovovic said.
“None of the attacks against her have been solved so far. Most of the stories that she had reported on, that point to crime, have not been investigated” by police, he added.
Lakić was attacked in the same place six years ago, when she was punched in the head multiple times.
Damjanovic said the police force would “do its best to uncover the perpetrators and bring them to justice”.
The assault, the second against a journalist in a month, prompted international concern.
“The attack on journalist Olivera Lakić is very worrying. Journalists must be protected,” European Union ambassador to Montenegro Aivo Orav wrote on Twitter.

Police blocked main streets in Podgorica, looking for the attacker.
Last month a bomb exploded near the home of a prominent journalist in the northern town of Bijelo Polje.
The EU, which Montenegro hopes to join by 2025, as well as international human rights and media organisations have been insisting that the authorities solve all the attacks against journalists and media organisations.
Many of the dozen or so assaults in the last 15 years, including the 2004 murder of editor Dusko Jovanović, remain unresolved.

                Thousands of Hungarians gathered Tuesday (8 May) to protest against strongman Viktor Orbán after he was nominated for re-election as prime minister for a third consecutive term during the inauguration of the new parliament.
Fresh from his right-wing Fidesz party’s landslide election win on 6 April, Orbán was officially proposed as prime minister by President János Áder in the first session of the new 199-seat assembly.



Orbán wins elections, far right gains ground
Hungarians handed their maverick Prime Minister Viktor Orbán another four years in power, election results showed today (7 April), while one in every five voters backed a far-right opposition party accused of anti-Semitism.


Orbán’s formal re-election by parliament and swearing in as premier is scheduled for Thursday.
In the third of a series of major protests organised on social media by a civil group since the election, around 20,000 protestors assembled outside parliament where speakers urged the rebuilding of opposition to Orbán and Fidesz.


Two demonstrations have been organised earlier today against the fourth #Orban government, a bigger event is planned for the evening. #HungaryElections #HungaryElection2018https://t.co/P35nk9j4EO
— Hungary Journal (@hungary_journal) May 8, 2018

“Either we stay in Hungary and begin working and acting now, or we do nothing and leave,” Viktor Gyetvai, a 20-year-old student, told the crowd.
The protesters say that Orbán’s win was mainly thanks to massive anti-immigration government propaganda, as well as an unfair election system in which Fidesz can only be beaten by a united opposition front.
Fidesz upset predictions of a tight contest by winning with 49% of the vote compared to under 20% for its nearest challenger, the nationalist Jobbik party.
That helped the party clinch a third consecutive two-thirds parliamentary majority, allowing it legislative carte blanche to amend the constitution and fast-track new laws.
Since the vote, Orbán has pledged to build a “Christian democracy” in the interests of all Hungarians and has called his victory “the biggest mandate” since the switch from communism in 1990.
Turnout increased sharply on previous elections, prompting Áder to say during his speech to open parliament that the legitimacy of the result is “above question”.
Constitutional change 
Orbán’s election campaign was dominated by strident anti-immigration rhetoric, and early signs are that he will continue in the same vein.
“The most important task of the new government will be the defence of Hungary’s security and Christian culture,” said the 54-year-old, who built anti-migrant border fences during the last term.
One of his first steps is likely to be a constitutional clause preventing the “settlement of alien population”.
Another package of bills targets non-governmental organisations funded by Hungarian-born US billionaire George Soros who Orbán says orchestrates immigration.



Orbán names Soros and EU among those ‘attacking’ Hungary
In the annual State of the Union address on Friday (10 February) Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán listed among those who “attacked” his country billionaire George Soros and the European Union.


Orbán’s critics also accuse him of removing democratic checks and balances and steering the country away from the European mainstream.
Further pressure on judicial and media independence, squeezed in recent years, are seen as likely by analysts.
On Monday the OSCE expressed “major concern” that three journalists for independent news websites were denied accreditation for the opening of parliament, saying this set “a bad precedent”.
‘Corrupt system’ 
The protestors, who call their group “We are the Majority”, have also held smaller demonstrations in cities around the country, a nod to sweeping electoral losses by the opposition outside Budapest.
Their demands include reform of the electoral system, redesigned by Fidesz in 2011 and which critics say helped deliver Orbán’s party its two-thirds majority, even though it won under half of the vote.
State media should also adhere to non-partisan guidelines according to the protestors after international observers found “media bias” had helped tilt the poll in Fidesz’s favour.
“The legitimacy of the new parliament is questionable,” an opposition MP Ákos Hadházy told AFP outside parliament Tuesday while the inauguration proceeded inside.
Hadházy, of the green LMP party, was the only lawmaker who refused to make an oath of allegiance to the constitution Tuesday.
“The opposition has to somehow find a way of not legitimising the government but at the same time do the actual work of a proper opposition,” he said.
A poll last week said opposition voters also blamed the bitterly divided anti-Orbán parties themselves for their crushing defeat.
Their failure to forge an effective anti-Fidesz front has prompted calls that they should boycott the new parliament or even that a new opposition be built from scratch.
Although “personnel, policy, and moral renewal” of the opposition parties is a must, Daniel Hegedüs, an analyst, told AFP that they could better serve frustrated voters by staying in parliament.
“Coordinated parliamentary and street opposition will have to be built up together during the coming years,” he said.

                New Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan used his first day in power on Wednesday (9 May) to call for deeper relations with both the European Union and Russia, but he also insisted that the public support that swept him to his new job will help build a majority government.
Speaking to Armenian and international reporters during his first day as prime minister, Pashinyan said he hoped that EU countries would implement the existing agreement with the Caucasus republic and move onto talks on visa liberalisation “soon”.
Pashinyan, who was appointed the head of an interim government on Tuesday (8 May), after almost a month of mass public protests, said that Armenians “deserved” to travel freely within Europe, a perk already enjoyed by neighbour Georgia.
Armenia-EU relations are now governed by an agreement (CEPA) brokered in early 2017. But a more ambitious deal including free trade options was scuppered in 2014, when Armenia joined the Russia-helmed Eurasian Union.
Yerevan has already ratified the partnership but most EU member states are yet to do so. Pashinyan hopes to see “tangible results” in that regard soon though.



Armenia's peaceful revolution yields new leader
Armenia’s parliament voted in favour of a new prime minister on Tuesday (8 May) as the romantically dubbed ‘love and solidarity revolution’ peacefully put the Caucasus republic’s opposition party in power.


Russian President Vladimir Putin was the first world leader to congratulate Pashinyan in a phone call and the interim leader revealed they had a “sincere conversation”.
He added that talks with Putin would continue on 15 May in Sochi, during a CSTO (Collective Security Treaty Organisation) summit, and that he only expected “positive developments” with Moscow in the future.
Pashinyan also later spoke to EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini, who congratulated the new leader and invited him to come to Brussels.
Asked by EURACTIV about US President Donald Trump’s decision to abandon the Iran nuclear deal, a country with which Armenia shares a border, Pashinyan acknowledged he was worried but insisted that any disputes would have to be solved around the negotiating table.
Former President Serzh Sargsyan backed the deal and European nations, particularly France, Germany and the United Kingdom are facing a race against time to convince Tehran that they and their partners can carry the agreement alone.
EU Climate Commissioner Miguel Arias Cañete will visit Iran next week to make Europe’s case to preserve a complex agreement that is as much about trade and energy as it is about nuclear weapons.

Armenia: Beginning of a former-Soviet bloc spring?
Armenia’s so-called ‘love and solidarity’ revolution largely came about because citizens were concerned that political reforms designed by now-ousted Prime minister Sargsyan were putting the country on an authoritarian path.
Though protests of a similar nature have flared up in countries like Ukraine, as well as EU members Hungary and Poland, Pashinyan insisted that it would be “impossible” to draw parallels with any other country due to the uniqueness of the factors at play, including geographical locations.



New Hungary protest as Orbán installs 'Christian democracy'
Thousands of Hungarians gathered Tuesday (8 May) to protest against strongman Viktor Orbán after he was nominated for re-election as prime minister for a third consecutive term during the inauguration of the new parliament.


He did reiterate that the revolution had been carried out without any violence and cited the fact that Sargsyan, who had been president for a decade, was still in Armenia and that a “peaceful atmosphere” is prevailing.
The former journalist-turned-premier wasted no time in leaving Armenia himself though, using his first day in the job to visit the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, a region over which Armenia and Azerbaijan have waged two deadly conflicts in recent history.
Nagorno-Karabakh, which self-styles itself as the Republic of Artsakh, wants the international community to recognise its independence but peace talks have proved fruitless, especially after April 2016 when conflict broke out for four days between the two countries.
Pashinyan was keen to emphasise that his concerns are the internal matters of Armenia and that Nagorno-Karabakh’s government and president are responsible for themselves. However, he did reiterate his hopes that the disputed region would be granted a place at the negotiating table again.
It is widely accepted that Nagorno-Karabakh would eventually seek unification with Armenia if it ever secured full recognition but the new prime minister insisted that any such decision would be made by the “people of the two republics”.
In a swipe at his predecessors, who often used the early part of their mandate to visit wealthier countries like Russia, Pashinyan pointed out that he had decided to visit Nagorno-Karabakh, a relatively poor part of the world.



Armenia PM resigns after days of mass protests
Armenian Prime Minister Serzh Sargsyan said on Monday (23 April) he would resign to help maintain peace in the ex-Soviet republic following daily street protests since before he took up the post on April 17.


Breaker of monopolies
Pashinyan failed in his first attempt to convince the Armenian parliament to support his candidacy but that all changed on Tuesday, when 59 of the 105-strong chamber voted in favour.
He has pledged to trigger new elections within two to three months and told reporters that the “much needed” ballot would be called in accordance with the constitution of the country.
Asked by reporters how he would put together a majority government, Pashinyan simply said that a majority backed his candidacy for the interim prime minister and that a fresh popular vote would yield similar results.
A popular figure, already infamous in Armenia for donning a khaki T-shirt and baseball cap during the revolution, Pashinyan is an outspoken critic of monopolies that hurt imports and oligarchs.
Although still cagey on who will be picked to serve in his new government, Pashinyan is adamant that no oligarchs will get the nod and is even hopeful that more women could be included in his team.

Pashinyan was keen to emphasise that his concerns are the internal matters of Armenia and that Nagorno-Karabakh’s government and president are responsible for themselves. However, he did reiterate his hopes that the disputed region would be granted a place at the negotiating table again. It is widely accepted that Nagorno-Karabakh would eventually seek unification with Armenia if it ever secured full recognition but the new prime minister insisted that any such decision would be made by the “people of the two republics”. In a swipe at his predecessors, who often used the early part of their mandate to visit wealthier countries like Russia, Pashinyan pointed out that he had decided to visit Nagorno-Karabakh, a relatively poor part of the world. Armenia PM resigns after days of mass protests Armenian Prime Minister Serzh Sargsyan said on Monday (23 April) he would resign to help maintain peace in the ex-Soviet republic following daily street protests since before he took up the post on April 17. Breaker of monopolies Pashinyan failed in his first attempt to convince the Armenian parliament to support his candidacy but that all changed on Tuesday, when 59 of the 105-strong chamber voted in favour. He has pledged to trigger new elections within two to three months and told reporters that the “much needed” ballot would be called in accordance with the constitution of the country. Asked by reporters how he would put together a majority government, Pashinyan simply said that a majority backed his candidacy for the interim prime minister and that a fresh popular vote would yield similar results. A popular figure, already infamous in Armenia for donning a khaki T-shirt and baseball cap during the revolution, Pashinyan is an outspoken critic of monopolies that hurt imports and oligarchs. Although still cagey on who will be picked to serve in his new government, Pashinyan is adamant that no oligarchs will get the nod and is even hopeful that more women could be included in his team.

                Fresh from a landslide election win in April, Hungary’s combative premier Viktor Orbán was formally sworn in as prime minister Thursday (10 May), and hinted at designs on power until at least 2030.
“I feel that when we set large goals for ourselves,… we are on the same wavelength as the people,” Orbán told newly-elected deputies inside the ornate parliament in Budapest.
“This emboldens and entitles to make plans not just for four years, but that we must think in terms of 10, or 12 years,” he said.
Such a timeline is “rational” as the next multi-year European Union budget – currently under negotiation – lasts until then, according to Orbán.
“I have always seen the 20-year-period between 2010 and 2030 as a unified era,” he said.
On 8 April the 54-year-old’s right-wing Fidesz party won its third consecutive two-thirds majority, granting it further legislative carte blanche to amend the constitution and fast-track new laws.



Orbán’s triumph sends shockwaves through Europe
Hungary’s anti-immigration Prime Minister Viktor Orbán basked Monday (9 April) in a bulldozer election triumph that delighted other nationalists but sent a chill through civil society groups and portended fresh battles with Brussels.


Since 2010 Fidesz have used so-called “supermajorities” to write a new constitution and launch a legislative blitz that opponents say has weakened democratic institutions and handed Orbán too much power.
Critics including the Organisation for Security and Co-Operation in Europe said biased state media and some election rules brought in by Orbán tilted the ballot in his favour.
Several opposition parties protested the result by not attending Thursday’s ceremonies.
Orbán was formally reelected as premier in the 199-seat assembly by 134 votes to 28 against.
After taking the oath of office he told deputies that the April election result reinforced the changes implemented since 2010.
“(It) showed that the people also thought that we have had a good eight years,” he said.
Despite the two-thirds majority, Orbán, who served a first term as prime minister between 1998 and 2002, said his new government will always “represent three-thirds,… all Hungarian citizens”.
In a wide-ranging address, he said that he wanted Hungary to be among the top five places to live and work in the whole EU by 2030.
Some of Orbán’s opponents suspect rather that he wants to steer Hungary out of the EU, and criticise his close relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.



EU’s Orban and ally Putin cement closer ties
Russian President Vladimir Putin and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán cemented closer ties at talks yesterday (2 February), amid growing EU rifts over sanctions against Moscow because of its meddling in Ukraine.


Orbán insisted Thursday that Hungary’s geographical location demands getting on with three powerful regional players: Germany, Russia and Turkey.
“Hungary must prioritise geopolitical considerations over ideological thinking. Hungary is and will remain a dedicated member of the Western alliance system. But that does not change the geographical constraints,” he said.
“To our west is the land of German iron chancellors, to our east is the world of Slavic soldier peoples, and to our south are massive crowds of Muslim people. Berlin, Moscow, Istanbul – Hungary exists in this space. We need to make calculations based on this.”
Urging the EU to respect the sovereignty of nation states he said multiculturalism and political correctness have led the bloc down a destructive path.
More migration into Europe would lead to further decay he warned, and offered that Hungary can lead “unavoidable” reforms.
“We need the EU and the EU needs us,” he said.
Give up federalist dreams 
The EU should give up its “delusional” idea of a United States of Europe, Orbán said on Thursday in pledging to defend his nation’s Christian values.
“The Union must function as an alliance of free nations and give up on its delusional nightmares of a United States of Europe,” Orbán told parliament in his inaugural speech.
“The EU must return to the grounds of reality. As a first step, it must change its thinking about migration.”
Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the EU executive, has jokingly referred to Orbán as a “dictator” over what critics say are the premier’s autocratic leanings.



Juncker greets Orbán with ‘Hello dictator!” 
European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker teased Hungarian Premier Viktor Orbán over his strongman reputation Friday, jokingly greeting him as “dictator” as he arrived at an EU summit in Riga.


Orbán has increased his control over the media and put allies in charge of once independent institutions. His hostility to accepting migrants – especially Muslims – into Hungary has put him in conflict with the Brussels-based EU, but proved popular in last month’s vote.
Orbán has also built a class of loyal businessmen whose control of key industries has grown rapidly to fulfil a government goal of keeping them in Hungarian hands.
He reiterated that his new government would build a “Christian democracy”. He promised to boost growth and competitiveness and reverse a decline in Hungary’s native population, while maintaining a tough line on immigration.



New Hungary protest as Orbán installs 'Christian democracy'
Thousands of Hungarians gathered Tuesday (8 May) to protest against strongman Viktor Orbán after he was nominated for re-election as prime minister for a third consecutive term during the inauguration of the new parliament.


“We will oppose the mandatory migrant settlement quotas… and will fight for the protection of borders,” he said.
Orbán also pronounced the era of liberal democracy to be over. “We have replaced a shipwrecked liberal democracy with a 21st-century Christian democracy, which guarantees people’s freedom, security,” Orbán told parliament.
Marton Gyongyosi, co-chairman of the main opposition party Jobbik, said after Orbán’s speech: “Hungary today is a country built on corruption, ruled and managed by oligarchs, a country which Hungarian youth leave in throngs.”

                French President Emmanuel Macron unveiled his long-term goals for Europe, including the need for unity, courage and action, at the Charlemagne Prize award ceremony held in Aachen on 10 May. EURACTIV.fr reports.
The speech Macron gave while accepting the Charlemagne Prize in Aachen was firmly centred on the rational imperatives plotting a moral path for the future of the EU.
The CDU mayor of the city gave the French president a warm welcome, asserting, in the presence of the German Chancellor, that: “We welcome here the person who currently provides the most momentum for Europe: Emmanuel Macron”, while also stressing the need for a commitment to Europe especially among young people. 
“We need to commit to Europe, not saying anything is unacceptable,” said Marcel Philipp, the mayor of Aachen, while also touching on energy issues such as nuclear power and the exit from coal.
Chancellor Angela Merkel also welcomed Macron, along with the Spanish King Felipe VI, the Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite, Martin Schulz, the former president of the European Parliament, Mario Draghi and Jean-Claude Trichet (of the European Central Bank), who had all previously been awarded the prize that highlights the European commitment of a public figure.
In her speech, Merkel insisted on the authority of democracy as mentioned by Macron in his Strasbourg speech to the European Parliament. Merkel also tentatively responded to France’s proposals, while calling for the establishment of a European university, a common migration policy, as well as for progress on the banking and monetary union by end June.
In terms of foreign policy, the Chancellor stated that “Europe has to take its fate into its own hands. It is its duty!”
Europe as a moral project
In his speech, Macron put forward four categorical imperatives, corresponding to the unconditional moral laws defined by German philosopher Immanuel Kant as universal maxims applying to everyone. Macron’s speech was mostly centred on the future of Europe, unlike his previous ones at the Sorbonne and in the European Parliament, which focused on Europe’s past and present.



Macron sinks teeth into EU taboos in forward-looking speech
Treaty change, agricultural policy and debt: French President Emmanuel Macron attacked a number of previously untouchable EU taboos during a speech focused on reform, sharing ambitious proposals for Europe’s future with university students. EURACTIV France reports.


Referring to the resurrection of Charlemagne’s dream, Macron pointed out that the dream of a united Europe was one plagued by doubt. ‘It is up to us to decide whether we let it live or leave it to die.”
Macron’s first imperative is the need for choice, in order to ensure European sovereignty. “We want to choose for ourselves,” stated the president, referring to the need for Europe to impose its own rules such as the GDPR and its climate change choices.
“We are the guardians of multilateralism,” he said, pointing out that the choice of peace in the Middle East had been the one advocated by Europe, and that it had to fight to keep it intact. The president also mentioned migration, arguing that only a common European policy on the subject could secure Europe.
“Let’s not be weak, let’s not endure, that is the first categorical imperative.”
Macron’s second imperative is to avoid divisions. “Isolationist tendencies reduce sovereignty,” he said of the north-south and east-west divisions.
“Over the last 10 years, much has been done, but at the price of a north-south division during the financial crisis, and one between the east and the west during the migrant crisis and these divisions have followed one after the other like a plague within Europe. Divisions lead to inaction, the only solution is unity.” 
The president then stressed the risk of division between France and Germany at a time when the two currently do not see eye to eye on the economic and monetary union.
He further called on Germans reluctant about reforms to wake up: “Wake up! France has changed, it is not the same” he said, urging Germany to show solidarity especially towards countries with high youth unemployment rates.
Macron also talked about “a more ambitious European budget, to defend the rule of law, and economic, fiscal and social convergence”.
The president’s third imperative was to overcome fear. “We are faced with the temptation to abandon the foundations of our democracy. Let’s not give up anything in the EU or in the Council of Europe,” he said while suggesting that there should no longer be any fear of each other’s taboos.
“In France, we must be ready to change the treaties and cut public spending. In the same way, Germany can no longer remain attached to maintaining budget and trade surpluses, as they are always achieved at someone else’s expense”. 
Indeed Germany has just announced that it wants a strict budget with cuts in public spending, running directly counter to what Macron is calling for and at the risk of creating an even larger rift between the imbalances of the southern European countries and Germany’s trade surpluses.
Macron’s last imperative is urgency. “Let’s not wait, the time [to act] is now”, acknowledging that France and Germany had waited a long time for each other.


For Europe:1. We must not be weak. We must choose.2. We must not be divided. We must unite.3. We must not be afraid. We must be daring.4. We must not wait. We must act now.https://t.co/KLlGTMQpC8
— Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) May 11, 2018

“Europe is a utopia, but here we are, so Europe exists. Utopists are pragmatics and realists”, Macron said in conclusion.
The Charlemagne Prize, which receives little attention in France, was closely followed in Germany, where public opinion seems to be largely receptive to Macron’s ideas, given that the country is known for being historically more pro-European than France.
According to an Infratest survey, 82% of Germans appreciate Macron’s European commitment, and 58% would like to see more fervour for the EU. For the time being, however, this does not seem to be taken into account by the German government, in view of its very strict budget and unwillingness to move forward on a eurozone budget.



Merkel: Europe can no longer rely on US to 'protect' it
Europe can no longer rely on the United States to protect it, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Thursday (10 May), urging the bloc to take its destiny in its own hands.

                Away from the spotlight, while Europe was biting its nails over Trump and Iran, one of the continent’s most far-flung corners had itself a peaceful revolution this week.
It may be too early to tell, but it’s worth asking: Could Armenia’s textbook ‘love and solidarity’ revolution hold the key to successful transitions of power elsewhere?
It’s not often that the South Caucasus makes headlines for anything other than violent conflict but the fall of former Prime Minister Serzh Sargsyan and rise of Nikol Pashinyan showed that the region is more than capable of bringing about change through peaceful means.
Once enough Armenians were concerned that controversial political reforms would put their country on the road to authoritarianism, Sargsyan’s days were numbered and mass public support propelled opposition rival Pashinyan to the top government job.
The protests were some of the most good-natured and colourful seen in recent years.
Over the course of nearly a month, there was a remarkable lack of police interventions against protesters and a similar absence of over-zealous behaviour on the part of demonstrators. Arrests were made but all parties have since admitted the scope was blown out of proportion.
But don’t underestimate the lengths Armenians went to in order to make their gripes known though. Streets of the capital were blocked, the airport was cut off, public squares were occupied and ruling party politicians prevented from getting a good night’s sleep by protesters camped outside their homes.
Although it took some time to convince Sargsyan’s Republicans to back Pashinyan, he was eventually given the nod to serve as the interim leader and will call elections later this year in order to try and form a majority government.
The atmosphere has proved to be so peaceful that even the deposed Sargsyan has remained in the country: not the usual hallmark of revolutions, where former leaders waste no time in catching the last chopper out of Saigon.
Protests of a similar slant have swept the EU in recent months, particularly in Hungary and Poland, but also Romania, Spain and the United Kingdom, as issues like rule of law, the Catalonia question and Brexit have drawn people en-masse into the streets.
At his first press conference as PM, Pashinyan refused to be drawn on parallels between Armenia’s revolution and scenes in Ukraine and beyond, insisting he is only interested in internal matters.
But the very basic concept of what has happened in Armenia is surely relevant to all people dissatisfied or afraid of what their elected representatives are doing on their behalf. Namely; that violence is not a prerequisite for a change to come about.
That is why Hungarians, Poles et al should take heart from their Armenian counterparts. The pressure told and Sargsyan admitted he had made a mistake. Shutting up and accepting things the way they are shouldn’t be the default course of action.

                The European Commission wants to ban disposable plastic dishware and cutlery. But critics say this is pointless and manufacturers are unimpressed by the idea. EURACTIV Germany’s media partner WirtschaftsWoche reports.
When it comes to plastic waste, even plastic manufacturers are becoming more contemplative. Thomas Piesik is the managing director of Wikon Thermoform, which makes the ‘Göffel’ – a spoon-and-fork in one [combination of the German words ‘Gabel’ and ‘Löffel’] – which come with salads and yoghurts sold in supermarkets nationwide.
Enter the European Commission: the EU executive wants to free the oceans and beaches of plastic through a new regulation, which is going to prohibit, among other things, straws, cotton buds and plastic cutlery. The details are not set yet but Piesik’s Göffels are likely to be affected.
But the manufacturer and the Commission actually agree in some respects. “Plastic does not belong in the world today.” This comment did not come from any environmental group but from Piesik himself.
In Indonesia, he drove past rivers where he could not see water because of the number of plastic bottles in it.
But the unanimity ends there. While Piesik sees plastic as a problem he means packaging rather than his folding cutlery.



EU warms up to plastic waste 'recycling' as transport fuel
A proposal to use non-recyclable plastic waste in the production of transport fuels is picking momentum among EU member states and legislators in the European Parliament, despite warnings from environmentalists. 


Even among environmental experts, the Commission’s planned initiative is not undisputed.
“If you want to have less plastic waste overall, the ban on straws or single-use tableware will only help a little,” said Henning Wilts, head of the Circular Economy Research Department at the Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy.
“In comparison to the 26 million tonnes of plastic waste, these are marginal quantities overall.”
Georg Mehlhart, a resource expert at the Öko-Institut in Freiburg, also questions the relevance of plastic cutlery in general. “When it comes to pollution of the oceans, there are much bigger problems,” he said, referring to microplastics and packaging.
Rwanda, East Africa, is one of the success stories putting Western nations in the shade. Its president, Paul Kagame, banned plastic bags and plastic packaging ten years ago.
Anyone looking for a piece of plastic waste on Kigali’s streets today will have to spend some time searching: streets across the country are spotless.
Even in villages far outside the capital, where peasants still plough the fields by hand and push sacks of potatoes to the market by bicycle, it is tidier than in many parts of European capitals like Berlin or Brussels.



Plastic-to-fuel, only fuelling fantasy
In light of the challenges that countries are facing due to China’s new standards on plastic recyclables imports, some controversial disposal methods have been getting increased attention, despite the myriad of concerns surrounding them, write Claire Arkin and Janek Vahk.


However, this only works because President Kagame has ruled the country with an iron fist since the 1994 genocide.
At the borders, customs officers frisk immigrants. Smugglers wrap plastic bags around their bodies as if they were attempting to smuggle drugs into the country.
Those who are caught face hefty penalties: smugglers can expect up to six months in prison. Time and again, plastic sinners are forced into public confessions in newspapers or on the radio. Shops have been closed because they have sold food in plastic wrap.
So the chances of Europe using Rwanda are a model have to be tempered. But how can the plastic problem be solved in a democracy? Not through banning plastic cutlery and straws, scientists agree.
“No single approach can solve the problem alone,” says Mehlhart. Similarly, Wilts explains, “I would like the Commission to regulate or ban fewer individual products.”
Instead, according to Wilts, there is a need for a comprehensive strategy that sees the plastic problem as a whole and offers solutions at all levels.
For example, recycled plastic should be subsidised, while oil subsidies, needed to produce new plastic, should  be cut. Instead of disposable packaging, reusable packaging should be promoted and backed up with deposit systems, especially when it comes to beverage bottles.
In addition, the industry should get concrete goals for how much packaging it has to save. How these are achieved, the companies could then decide for themselves. In the UK, that has already happened, says Wilts – and it’s very successful.



Cotton buds and plastic straws could be banned in England next year
Cotton buds, plastic drinking straws and other single-use plastics could be banned from sale in England next year in the next phase of the campaign to try to halt the pollution of the world’s rivers and oceans. EURACTIV’s partner The Guardian reports.


However, spoon manufacturer Piesik does not believe anything will change for him at all. The plastic issue has become increasingly popular in recent years among politicians and many have used it to raise their profile. But hardly anything has happened so far.
It is not only Piesik who expects the Commission’s current proposal to be diluted, until it finally finds its way into national laws – if at all. “It does not make me nervous at the moment.”

                The EU and Cuba signed a renewable energy deal on Tuesday (15 May), a step towards normalising relations in defiance of Washington’s continuing hardline stance on Havana.
As it scrambles to save the Iran nuclear deal after US President Donald Trump ditched it last week, the EU sought to add substance to its landmark cooperation agreement with Cuba, which came into effect in November.
EU diplomatic chief Federica Mogherini has condemned the US economic blockade of the communist island as “obsolete” and “illegal”, but under Trump the US has rolled back the rapprochement championed by his predecessor Barack Obama.



EU foreign policy chief says 'blockade' of Cuba not solution
Blockading Cuba is not the solution, the European Union’s foreign policy chief said yesterday (3 January) on a trip aimed at strengthening ties with Havana, after Washington tightened restrictions on the island.


Mogherini and Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla led the first meeting of the EU-Cuba Joint Council in Brussels.
The highlight was the signing of an €18 million project to support Cuba’s goal of getting a quarter of its energy from renewable sources by 2030.
The EU also plans to finance a food security support programme for the island with a contribution of €19.7 million.
“Today we celebrate an important step in relations between the EU and Cuba,” Mogherini said.
“We want to construct a closer relationship based on open and frank dialogue and mutual respect and effective cooperation.”
Cuba turned a page in its history last month when Miguel Diaz-Canel took over as president after nearly 60 years of rule by revolutionary leader Fidel Castro and then his brother Raul.
Havana and Brussels also launched dialogues focusing on five areas including sustainable development, non-proliferation, human rights and unilateral measures.
The last section will deal with the US embargo. Havana is hoping the EU will prove to be an ally against Trump.
The agreement with Cuba, so far ratified by 13 of the 28 EU member states, can be suspended in case of grave rights abuses.



EU-Cuba relations enter new era
The European Parliament on Wednesday (5 July) greenlit a new political dialogue and cooperation agreement between the EU and Cuba, marking the beginning of a new era of relations between Brussels and Havana. EURACTIV Spain reports.


The EU’s 28 countries are the main foreign investors in Cuba, mainly in the tourism and building sectors, the EU says.
The bloc imported some €470 million worth of Cuban goods in 2017 and exported more than two billion euros’ worth.
Cuba as a broker in Venezuela
Mogherini said Cuba could help broker fresh dialogue between the government and opposition in Venezuela, despite Havana’s frequent assurances the crisis afflicting its leftist ally was a sovereign matter.
“I personally believe that Cuba could play a positive role in trying to avoid further negative developments (in Venezuela) and trying to re-open and negotiate a political solution and dialogue,” Mogherini told a joint news conference with the Cuban foreign minister.
Venezuela will hold a presidential election on 20 May that the opposition coalition is boycotting, saying it is a farce intended to legitimize a “dictatorship” led by President Nicolas Maduro.



EU says it may impose more sanctions on Venezuela if democracy undermined
The European Union said on Thursday it could impose further sanctions on Venezuela if it believes democracy is being undermined there, after the South American country’s president called for elections next month that the main opposition has said it will boycott.


The Lima Group of largely Latin American nations on Monday urged the Venezuelan government to suspend the vote, calling the process “illegitimate and lacking in credibility.”
Cuba has played the role of broker in several disputes in recent years, notably hosting peace talks between the Colombian government and Marxist rebel groups it has been at war with for five decades.
The Cuban government has stood steadfast by Venezuela, denouncing foreign interference in its internal affairs, despite a sharp decline in subsidized Venezuelan oil shipments amid the OPEC nation’s economic crisis.

                The success of the accession process of the Western Balkan countries needs “meaningful involvement” of civil society organisations in the integration process, Luca Jahier, president of the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC), told EURACTIV.
Luca Jahier, an Italian national, was recently elected as the 32nd president EESC, the EU body representing organised civil society, which he will head for the next two and a half years.
“Only if citizens are aware that the accession to EU will improve their quality of life and that of their children, we’ll see a positive outcome,” Jahier emphasised.
He explained that for these reasons it’s crucial that civil society organisations in the Western Balkans work closely together, both at national and local levels to demand citizens’ involvement.
“Citizens need to own the process so that they can shape it in a sustainable way,” he added.
As for the EESC’s role in this procedure, Jahier noted it would continue to develop its bilateral and regional relations with civil society organisations in the region in order to strengthen civil society networks and therefore contribute to the consolidation of democracy.
Deep concerns
EESC’s chief explained that there was “deep concern” about the shrinking space for civil society in an increasing number of countries in the Western Balkans.
“EU enlargement policy must focus more on democratisation, the rule of law, intra-regional cooperation and the building of trust, as well as a more structured and systematic approach in terms of civil society participation.”
He insisted that freedom of expression and free media are prerequisites for establishing solid democracies and allowing a vibrant civil society to develop.
“Civil society must be vocal and take the lead in denouncing the negative developments in the region in relation to freedom of expression, such as political pressure on the media,” he emphasised.
EESC and the European Commission organised yesterday (15 May) in Sofia a conference about the cohesion of the Western Balkan region and set a number of recommendations that will be submitted to EU leaders ahead of a crucial EU-Western Balkans summit on 17 May.
“Social, economic and territorial cohesion should be assessed when evaluating the fulfillment of EU membership criteria,” the participants noted.
They also raised a number of issues, ranging from quality education and necessary economic reforms to the protection of minorities and the empowerment of women.
Weak labor markets 
According to World Bank figures, youth unemployment remains “critically high” in the region.
“Unemployment declined during 2017 by an estimated 200,000 people, from 23 to 21%, but inactivity remains high, especially among women, the low-educated, and youth. In addition, informal employment and long-term unemployment remain a significant challenge in the region,” the World Bank said.
Mirna Jusić, from the Analitika Center for Social Research in Bosnia and Herzegovina told EURACTIV that the region suffers from high income inequality, caused in large part by weak labour markets.
This inevitably leads to the so-called ‘brain drain’ phenomenon.
“The recent years a strong trend of immigration has been remarked. In the long run, this will have devastating effects on the economies of these countries for their growth and competitiveness,” she said.
Jusić underlined that the EU should focus on “investing more in active labor market policies, in quality education so that people in the region really have the benefit of decent jobs with adequate income and quality public services.”
Give an end to domestic violence
Another crucial element of the discussion was the role of women in Western Balkan societies and particularly the lack of sufficient institutional response to domestic violence.
Iliriana Banjska from Kosovo Women’s Network noted that the time has come to impose more punitive measures.
“We need to send the message to perpetrators that domestic violence will be prosecuted, to send a message to underperforming responsible institutions that failing to adhere to operational procedures in relation to domestic violence will be scrutinised.”
“When we talk about the Western Balkans, we tend to fall into a trap of exotifying certain phenomena such as domestic violence: “This is part of our culture”, “this is a result of the wars” etc,” she said.
She explained that domestic violence is a worldwide issue but the difference with Western Balkans institutions fails to address it sufficiently.
“For the Western Balkans, this remains to be the biggest challenge to tackle. Insufficient confidentiality, victim-blaming and attempts at family reconciliation remain prevalent.”
“Civil society organisations working on the promotion and protection of women’s rights should be recognised as important partners in conducting comprehensive and systematic reforms aimed at achieving gender equality in practice,” commented Jahier.

                For 25 years, the internet allowed business models to rampantly grow and radically change everyday life. Now, a period of regulation has come – and the awareness of the impact of digitisation. EURACTIV Germany’s media partner “Der Tagesspiegel” reports.
One can still buy baked goods without the help of the internet or other digital aids, although baking requires local knowledge and a suitable recipe.
However, almost 30 years after the invention of the internet and 25 years after the World Wide Web was opened for use and constant development to the public on April 30, 1993, it has revolutionised everyday life – new industries, cultural techniques and dependencies have emerged, since computers effectively communicate remotely.
The net was supposed to allow for a rule-free discourse without state or economic dependencies and controls, and some of these utopias have become reality: oppressing opinions is far more difficult than it was in the 1980s while sending opinions to the world has never been so easy and cheap as it is today.
But the history of the internet is also one of rapid and almost unlimited commercialisation. From the idea of decentralised communication to an infinite number of individual networked computers, global corporations have emerged that not only market transmission capacity and storage space but also manage every communication with their respective software and with more and more networked devices – including their own production machines, medical devices, kitchen appliances and toys. At the same time, they store, link and market the data produced and collected.



Work 4.0 – opportunities and risks
Digitization is on everyone’s lips and will change the working world in the next couple of years. For employers this poses a range of risks – but could also open some chances, as a recent analysis shows. EURACTIV Germany reports.


Today, this economic chain is often more of a one-way street than a cycle: companies collect data, mine and multiply their value through processing and constantly develop new techniques for their further propagation and specification. The producers of data are paid for it with services that make their life more convenient: from health to travel and leisure-time.
But it is only supposedly free of charge because everyone pays with their data. German Minister of Culture and Media, Monika Grütters (CDU), recalled this in a commentary for the “Tagesspiegel”: “The price of the business model of convenience is to a considerable extent our data.” For this, awareness has yet to be developed.
“Monopolies today arise from user numbers and data – which, however, are not regarded as economic value”, explains Anke Domscheid-Berg, head of the “Digital Agenda” committee of the German Bundestag.
Producers of data are often referred to not as customers but – persistently and euphemistically – as users. At best, the seemingly free service of social networks, search engines, and apps is sometimes counted up in return for the masses of personal data that they generate, query, record, store, compare, link, and sell.
Almost everything has a digital component – and a data track
Each photograph taken with a phone or digital camera will store not only the actual image but also the exact location, the exact time – including whereabouts of both, the photographer and the photographed, and by facial recognition software maybe even the mood of each person.
Such information can be combined with data traces from online shopping or discount cards, travel bookings and news sites readings, information about friends and interests on Facebook or Google, dress sizes and skin colors, home address and navigation data, signs of disease from optical and haptic applications on smartphone or e-reader – and added up to a profile.
This data can help mankind, coordinated by networked knowledge and action, to effectively protect the environment and make good use of energy, to strengthen research and education, share opinions and knowledge.
Digitisation is thus still following its initial utopias. However, the data masses can also be used for monitoring and tracking purposes, for social or economic disadvantage, for influencing.
In any case, their very existence in states, companies and digital networks also completely redefines the privacy of each individual, the sense of it and many everyday activities – the sole knowledge can lead to feelings of inferiority, powerlessness or omnipotence, to fear of persecution and mistrust.



Commission demands EU leaders approve deadlocked ePrivacy bill
The European Commission is amping up pressure on EU leaders to approve a controversial privacy bill, deadlocked in legal talks for more than a year, after the data breach scandal involving Facebook and Cambridge Analytica.


Behind it stands a completely different perception and use of the public. For Grütters, “digitisation puts democracy and the rule of law to the test”: the Internet “currently allows more freedom than democracy can tolerate”.
Civilisational achievements such as the freedom of art and expression of art, cultural and media diversity, copyrights and personal protection would therefore need “a political update: an adaptation to changing framework conditions”.
Data protection has to reposition itself
On May 25, the GDPR will enter into force in all 28 EU member states, replacing the old EU data protection guidelines from 1995 – a time when everyday life was still far from being fully digitised and many common techniques used today were not even imaginable.
As a regulation, the new law automatically has legal force and does not have to be translated into national law. It actually has been in effect since the end of May 2016 but by the time the transitional period expires, companies must have adapted to better protect data than they did before.
An important goal is data sovereignty of customers and users: According to the new rules anyone can request detailed information about the handling of their data from the companies – and also the data stored there can be transmitted.
With the so-called ‘Right to be forgotten’ one can request to delete data, for example, to remove youthful sins or unpleasant missteps, at least in the digital biography – if there are no legal reasons or a public interest to keep them.
Merkel: Artificial intelligence without data masses is “like a cow that does not get food”
Users should become independent from platforms and be able to “move” without data loss, for example from one social network to another – because this raw material is theirs.
As with large legislative projects, there have been years of intensive lobbying against excessive regulations, even German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Grand coalition have repeatedly pointed to the importance of data economy.
This week, Merkel warned that, of course, people should be able to dispose of their data – but the rules should not become “impractical” as artificial intelligence, for instance, cannot develop without large amounts of data as raw material.



Commission expects EU countries to set ‘high fines’ under new cybersecurity law
European Commission officials who pushed through new cybersecurity legislation set to take effect next week are expecting EU countries to introduce high fines against companies that disobey the rules.


While large companies have now implemented the requirements and adjusted their terms of use (which have become a bit longer, but more understandable), many small companies, start-ups, freelancers and clubs experienced an eleventh-hour panic – not only because not everything in the new basic regulation is clear.
The boundaries between privacy and public have long since become unclear in the digital society: in what area is the internet a public medium, a private album or entrepreneurial tool?
Again and again, clever lawyers scent a treasure behind the ambiguity. Whether it will cause a wave of lawsuits remains to be seen. It can be expected that many individual, borderline and special cases will be tried in court – and will make the digital rights more concrete and understandable.
Companies and authorities must be able to design basic settings for their services in a manner that protects their privacy and documents the compliant handling of the data and, if in doubt, can prove this in court.
In the event of grave violations, data protection authorities may impose fines on companies of up to €20 million in the future, or four percent of the worldwide annual turnover of a company, whichever is bigger. For big companies, that can go into the billions. Until now,  it’s been €300,000 at most.
Digital life needs digital fundamental rights
German Justice Minister Katarina Barley (SPD) demanded transparency on the artificial intelligence algorithms at the internet conference re:publica.
Citizens need to be able to understand the functioning of the systems that generate specific recommendations and information – they also have one in the interest of democratic neutrality appropriately regulated programming is possible in the long term.
Like Domscheid-Berg and sociologist Heinz Bude, Barley supports the development of a Charter of Digital Fundamental Rights of the EU – which goes far beyond data protection.



Schools of tomorrow – building and transforming skills for a digital world
Europe’s bid to lead the digital and advanced technology trend will be lost if the EU and national governments don’t take steps to make skills development in digitisation their priority. Digital skills need to be conveyed at all levels and in all forms of education to ensure Europe’s global position, writes Martina Dlabajová.


At the initiative of ex-European Parliament President Martin Schulz (SPD), the late FAZ co-editor Frank Schirrmacher and “Time” Editor-in-Chief and “Tagesspiegel” editor Giovanni di Lorenzo, for several years a charter has been in the works, aiming to promote freedom, equality and human dignity, democratic principles and Individual rights translated into the digital age.
When presented by the “Zeit”-Foundation, it was declared that “the time of the robber barons” has to come to an end:
While digital companies created for decades their own rules and conditions, because their technical and cultural innovations were moving faster than state and social regulation, we now have a “civilisation” of the global network and data economy.
After ideas have become business models and business models have become global corporations, the ideas of society – of the state and the citizens – are getting better understood and critically questioned as to who benefits and who suffers.
A renegotiation is taking place about who owns data and data collections – their producers, their collectors or the general public?
And since individual companies have created an industry, regulation is also in their very own interest:
If idea-based data is to become physical – such as smart cities, furniture or food from 3D printers, “then DIN standards” are needed. There is no industrial network without norms and rules according to which data can be connected, compared and processed further.
            ","For 25 years, the internet allowed business models to rampantly grow and radically change everyday life. Now, a period of regulation has come – and the awareness of the impact of digitisation. EURACTIV Germany’s media partner “Der Tagesspiegel” reports. One can still buy baked goods without the help of the internet or other digital aids, although baking requires local knowledge and a suitable recipe. However, almost 30 years after the invention of the internet and 25 years after the World Wide Web was opened for use and constant development to the public on April 30, 1993, it has revolutionised everyday life – new industries, cultural techniques and dependencies have emerged, since computers effectively communicate remotely. The net was supposed to allow for a rule-free discourse without state or economic dependencies and controls, and some of these utopias have become reality: oppressing opinions is far more difficult than it was in the 1980s while sending opinions to the world has never been so easy and cheap as it is today. But the history of the internet is also one of rapid and almost unlimited commercialisation. From the idea of decentralised communication to an infinite number of individual networked computers, global corporations have emerged that not only market transmission capacity and storage space but also manage every communication with their respective software and with more and more networked devices – including their own production machines, medical devices, kitchen appliances and toys. At the same time, they store, link and market the data produced and collected. Work 4.0 – opportunities and risks Digitization is on everyone’s lips and will change the working world in the next couple of years. For employers this poses a range of risks – but could also open some chances, as a recent analysis shows. EURACTIV Germany reports. Today, this economic chain is often more of a one-way street than a cycle: companies collect data, mine and multiply their value through processing and constantly develop new techniques for their further propagation and specification. The producers of data are paid for it with services that make their life more convenient: from health to travel and leisure-time. But it is only supposedly free of charge because everyone pays with their data. German Minister of Culture and Media, Monika Grütters (CDU), recalled this in a commentary for the “Tagesspiegel”: “The price of the business model of convenience is to a considerable extent our data.” For this, awareness has yet to be developed. “Monopolies today arise from user numbers and data – which, however, are not regarded as economic value”, explains Anke Domscheid-Berg, head of the “Digital Agenda” committee of the German Bundestag. Producers of data are often referred to not as customers but – persistently and euphemistically – as users. At best, the seemingly free service of social networks, search engines, and apps is sometimes counted up in return for the masses of personal data that they generate, query, record, store, compare, link, and sell. Almost everything has a digital component – and a data track Each photograph taken with a phone or digital camera will store not only the actual image but also the exact location, the exact time – including whereabouts of both, the photographer and the photographed, and by facial recognition software maybe even the mood of each person. Such information can be combined with data traces from online shopping or discount cards, travel bookings and news sites readings, information about friends and interests on Facebook or Google, dress sizes and skin colors, home address and navigation data, signs of disease from optical and haptic applications on smartphone or e-reader – and added up to a profile. This data can help mankind, coordinated by networked knowledge and action, to effectively protect the environment and make good use of energy, to strengthen research and education, share opinions and knowledge. Digitisation is thus still following its initial utopias. However, the data masses can also be used for monitoring and tracking purposes, for social or economic disadvantage, for influencing. In any case, their very existence in states, companies and digital networks also completely redefines the privacy of each individual, the sense of it and many everyday activities – the sole knowledge can lead to feelings of inferiority, powerlessness or omnipotence, to fear of persecution and mistrust. Commission demands EU leaders approve deadlocked ePrivacy bill The European Commission is amping up pressure on EU leaders to approve a controversial privacy bill, deadlocked in legal talks for more than a year, after the data breach scandal involving Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. Behind it stands a completely different perception and use of the public. For Grütters, “digitisation puts democracy and the rule of law to the test”: the Internet “currently allows more freedom than democracy can tolerate”. Civilisational achievements such as the freedom of art and expression of art, cultural and media diversity, copyrights and personal protection would therefore need “a political update: an adaptation to changing framework conditions”. Data protection has to reposition itself On May 25, the GDPR will enter into force in all 28 EU member states, replacing the old EU data protection guidelines from 1995 – a time when everyday life was still far from being fully digitised and many common techniques used today were not even imaginable. As a regulation, the new law automatically has legal force and does not have to be translated into national law. It actually has been in effect since the end of May 2016 but by the time the transitional period expires, companies must have adapted to better protect data than they did before. An important goal is data sovereignty of customers and users: According to the new rules anyone can request detailed information about the handling of their data from the companies – and also the data stored there can be transmitted. With the so-called ‘Right to be forgotten’ one can request to delete data, for example, to remove youthful sins or unpleasant missteps, at least in the digital biography – if there are no legal reasons or a public interest to keep them.

                The President of the Party of European Socialists (PES), Sergei Stanishev, praised on  Wednesday (16 May) the efforts by Athens and Skopje to resolve the long-standing name dispute and urged them to show “leadership” against nationalistic trends.
Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and FYROM’s Zoran Zaev participated at the PES preparatory gathering ahead of their bilateral meeting today on the sidelines of the EU-Western Balkans summit in Sofia.
Both leaders seemed cautiously optimistic about the progress of the negotiation on the issue that has effectively blocked Skopje’s efforts to join NATO and the EU.
Asked about their meeting, Tsipras said he had “great expectations” while Zaev noted he expected “only success”.
“The socialist leaders welcomed our efforts so far to find a mutually acceptable solution to the name dispute,” Tsipras tweeted following the meeting.
“They pointed out that only progressive leaders could do it,” Tsipras added.
“I want to declare my firm support for Alexis Tsipras and Zoran Zaev for their efforts to resolve the name issue, which has been stalled for 30 years […] I’m aware that there are nationalistic fears, but the political leader has to take all this in order to move things forward,” Stanishev noted.
Asked by EURACTIV.com if he had fears that the opposition parties in both countries could derail a potential deal between the two governments, he replied this would be a “great challenge”.
“It’s important for the political forces in Greece and Macedonia to think strategically,” he emphasised.



Tensions grow before biggest secret is revealed: FYROM's new name
The opposition VMRO-DPMNE of former Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski in Skopje, possibly encouraged by Russia, is trying to hinder the resolution of a name dispute with Greece that has blocked the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia’s (FYROM) progress in joining NATO and the European Union.


He referred to the Bulgarian-Macedonian friendship treaty, which was signed in August 2017 after a long period during which Macedonia was dominated by the hardline VMRO-DPMNE party [EPP] of Nikola Gruevski.
In the bilateral treaty, the countries committed to respecting each other’s national sovereignty and territorial integrity and renounce any territorial claims.
Stanishev pointed out that there were fears and mutual suspicion about the agreement as well, but since its adoption, there has been a “tremendous boost to trade for instance”.



Bulgaria and Macedonia start removing hurdles to relations
During new Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev’s visit to Sofia on Tuesday (20 June), it was announced that Bulgaria and Macedonia will soon sign a bilateral treaty, removing some obstacles to Skopje’s bid to join NATO and the EU.


“People want to look positively toward the future, not with fear,” Stanishev added.
Kyriakos Mitsotakis, leader of the main opposition New Democracy party [EPP], said yesterday that a solution to the name dispute has, as a prerequisite, not only to be applied erga omnes, but also the constitutional change in the neighbouring country.
“The constitutional change is a precondition and our country cannot make any concession,” Mitsotakis said.
Greek pro-government media commented that New Democracy had made a U-turn considering that a couple of months ago it had noted that the negotiations should be halted and a solution sought at another time.
The leader of the centre-right European People’s Party (EPP), Joseph Daul, recently told EURACTIV.com that he hoped a mutually acceptable solution would be found and that his political force welcomes “this window of opportunity that could lead to concrete results”.
His statement triggered strong reactions in Athens with the government accusing Mitsotakis of being isolated on the case, even at the EU level.
Manfred Weber, leader of the EPP in the European Parliament, reacted by expressing his full political trust in Mitsotakis; however, he did not make clear if the EPP agreed with the New Democracy’s stance on the issue.
EURACTIV also contacted the EPP and asked if the issue of the Macedonian name dispute was discussed yesterday during the party’s preparatory meeting. By the time of this article’s publication, no response has been provided.

The leader of the centre-right European People’s Party (EPP) Joseph Daul hailed the “window of opportunity” to resolve a long-standing name dispute between Greece and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), saying he hopes for “concrete” results.


Later in the day, both Zaev and Stanishev took part in a talk show on the Bulgarian national television BNT. Zaev said among other things that Athens and Skopje had agreed on the name, but the anchor did not ask for more details.

                Athens and Skopje have moved closer to resolving their long-running name dispute but are not yet in a position to talk about an agreement, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said on Thursday (17 May).
Tsipras and his counterpart from the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, met in Sofia on the sidelines of an EU-Western Balkans summit. Greece opposes the name Macedonia because it has a province by the same name, and the dispute has been deadlocked for more than 25 years, blocking Macedonia’s progress towards NATO and EU membership.
Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, who hosted the summit, hinted that there had been real progress in the Greece-Macedonia talks but said that both leaders would make announcements in their capitals, not abroad, when the time comes.
Speaking at a press conference, Tsipras said he aimed to meet Zaev again in early June, but there would be other steps to take in the meantime.
“We have reached a critical point but the last steps are always more difficult,” Tsipras underlined.
“We have the pressure of historical responsibility but FYROM has the pressure of time,” the leftist leader said, referring to Skopje’s ambitions to join the EU and NATO.
“We were discussing many options and we agreed on one that is acceptable to both sides,” said Zaev.
Tsipras was more cautious, saying the two were “not yet in a position” to announce a deal to end the 25-year row, but conceding they were much closer to resolving it.
Both sides wanted to have a result before the General Affairs Council in June.
He explained that the aim of both sides was a deal that will be embraced by the people, stand the test of time and respect the cultural heritage and history of both sides.
Asked by EURACTIV.com if they had discussed the stance of opposition parties’ in both countries on the issue, he replied, “Of course, it’s a critical issue”.
“Not so much for us, but for the domestic affairs of our neighbour, as our position requires a constitutional change [in Macedonia] which needs qualified majorities. So yes, it was one of the points of discussion between us,” Tsipras emphasised.
EURACTIV reported in January that Macedonian opposition party VMRO-DPMNE of former Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski was trying to block talks. As prime minister, Gruevski had taken a hard line on the issue and negotiations were frozen for many years.
A former minister who belongs to VMRO-DPMNE told EURACTIV in January that Zaev’s government “shows flexibility to impress their neighbours but in the long run, they have to have public opinion on their side as well”.

“Cooperating at least on national issues will help the country,” Tsipras said.
Zaev: Solution before June
Speaking at a separate press conference after the summit, Zaev voiced hope for a solution before the June summit but added that “if this not the case, we won’t stop there”.
“Together with Prime Minister Tsipras, we looked at possible options for creative solutions, which the Macedonian side presented in the last phase of the negotiations. What follows is the consultations with relevant political factors in both countries,” Zaev added.
“From today, the friendship between the Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Greece is even stronger. We are solving the dispute in order to strengthen the dignity and identity of the citizens in both countries,” Zaev concluded.

                As Italy gets closer to having a cabinet dominated by the 5-Star Movement, the rejection of this force by the liberal ALDE group in January 2017 increasingly looks like a strategic mistake.
5-Star has 17 MEPs. When they applied to join ALDE a year and a half ago, some thought the temptation would be too big to turn them down, not least because this would allow the liberals to reclaim their status as the third largest faction in the European Parliament. The ALDE group has 68 MEPs and ranks fourth after the Eurosceptic ECR with 73.
Others saw it differently. The pressure was high on ALDE not to appear opportunistic and ready to make ideological concessions, and the liberals rejected 5-Star’s application.
As a result, 14 5-Star MEPs joined the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy group (where UKIP sits), while the other three defected to other groups.
It is true that in January 2017 the leader of the 5-Star Movement was firebrand populist Beppe Grillo. Luigi Di Maio, a much more pragmatic politician, took over only last September.
But the fact remains that a big opportunity was missed to open the way for 5-Star into mainstream European politics, or at least to extract them from the anti-establishment fringes.
If 5-Star were in ALDE today, a cabinet led by Luigi Di Maio would not scare the markets, or make Russia’s Vladimir Putin appear as the winner of the Italian elections.
As 5-Star is on the verge of reaching a government deal with the Northern League (now self-styling itself simply as the League), their coalition agreement proposes that EU sanctions against Russia be dropped immediately.
Of course, there are ideological differences between 5-Star and the European liberal parties. But part of the purpose of the mainstream European political families is to educate their new members.
Most of the Eastern European parties that joined the Socialist political family twenty years ago were genuinely communist, now some are (arguably) social-democrats.
It’s true that the EPP hasn’t always been successful, at least with Viktor Orbán’s Fidesz, but by not excluding him they still keep some leverage and prevent his force from starting a new illiberal and nationalist European project.
There is a temptation today for new forces, such as Emmanuel Macron’s En Marche, to establish their own European movements instead of joining the existing ones. This is another reason why ALDE’s rejection of 5-Star was a misstep. If you can’t beat them, co-opt them.

The clock is ticking. Britain will leave the customs union, says British PM Theresa May, but she insists that there will be no hard border with EU member Ireland.
Now or never. According to France, the euro area won’t survive without reform. The country is now stepping up the pressure on hesitant Germany, a few weeks ahead of a crucial European Council summit.
Border watch. Poland, holding the presidency of the UN Security Council, has asked for the deployment of a UN peacekeeping force in Ukraine’s conflict zone, as violations of the Minsk II peace agreement continue.
Workers on the move. Czech firms in the south-west are facing labour shortages as increasing numbers of residents living close to the border commute to Germany for work.
Fighting forgery. Austria’s government ‘declares war’ on social fraud and organised illegal work.
Ending political deadlock? Italy is on the brink of finally getting a new government as the 5-Star Movement and the Lega Nord on verge of reaching a coalition deal with controversial content.
Leading the way. Ahead of a much-anticipated proposal from the Commission, the Netherlands called on Europe to aim high on emissions standards for trucks and cars.
Double standards? ‘Kosovo is not Catalonia’, Kosovar President Thaci told absent Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy at the Sofia EU-Western Balkans summit. However, Pristina acknowledges the sensitivity of the issue.
Going nuclear. Six years after freezing the construction of a second nuclear power plant, Bulgarian PM Boyko Borissov intends to restart the project with the help of Chinese investors.
            ","As Italy gets closer to having a cabinet dominated by the 5-Star Movement, the rejection of this force by the liberal ALDE group in January 2017 increasingly looks like a strategic mistake. 5-Star has 17 MEPs. When they applied to join ALDE a year and a half ago, some thought the temptation would be too big to turn them down, not least because this would allow the liberals to reclaim their status as the third largest faction in the European Parliament. The ALDE group has 68 MEPs and ranks fourth after the Eurosceptic ECR with 73. Others saw it differently. The pressure was high on ALDE not to appear opportunistic and ready to make ideological concessions, and the liberals rejected 5-Star’s application. As a result, 14 5-Star MEPs joined the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy group (where UKIP sits), while the other three defected to other groups. It is true that in January 2017 the leader of the 5-Star Movement was firebrand populist Beppe Grillo. Luigi Di Maio, a much more pragmatic politician, took over only last September. But the fact remains that a big opportunity was missed to open the way for 5-Star into mainstream European politics, or at least to extract them from the anti-establishment fringes. If 5-Star were in ALDE today, a cabinet led by Luigi Di Maio would not scare the markets, or make Russia’s Vladimir Putin appear as the winner of the Italian elections. As 5-Star is on the verge of reaching a government deal with the Northern League (now self-styling itself simply as the League), their coalition agreement proposes that EU sanctions against Russia be dropped immediately. Of course, there are ideological differences between 5-Star and the European liberal parties. But part of the purpose of the mainstream European political families is to educate their new members. Most of the Eastern European parties that joined the Socialist political family twenty years ago were genuinely communist, now some are (arguably) social-democrats. It’s true that the EPP hasn’t always been successful, at least with Viktor Orbán’s Fidesz, but by not excluding him they still keep some leverage and prevent his force from starting a new illiberal and nationalist European project. There is a temptation today for new forces, such as Emmanuel Macron’s En Marche, to establish their own European movements instead of joining the existing ones. This is another reason why ALDE’s rejection of 5-Star was a misstep. If you can’t beat them, co-opt them. Inside Track By Alexandra Brzozowski The clock is ticking.

                A coalition of activist groups on Monday (21 May) announced a campaign to break up Facebook, arguing that the huge social network “has too much power over our lives and democracy.”
The groups created a website, and a Facebook page, to garner support for a petition to the US Federal Trade Commission to require the social media firm to spin off Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger into competing networks, and to “impose strong privacy rules.”
The effort was launched by a handful of groups focusing on digital rights, privacy and other social causes, under the Freedom From Facebook banner.


Tell the @FTC that it is time to break up Facebook’s monopoly. Make Facebook safe for democracy and sign the petition: https://t.co/5ZryFuhdKF
— Freedom From Facebook (@FacebookBreakup) May 20, 2018

“Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg have amassed a scary amount of power,” the groups said on their website.
“Facebook unilaterally decides the news that billions of people around the world see every day. It buys up or bankrupts potential competitors to protect its monopoly, killing innovation and choice. It tracks us almost everywhere we go on the web and, through our smartphones, even where we go in the real world.”
The effort comes with Facebook under fire in the US and elsewhere over the hijacking of private user data on some 87 million users, adding to concerns on how internet platforms were manipulated to spread misinformation during the 2016 US election.



After Facebook scandal, MEPs argue the GDPR isn’t enough
The EU needs more legal safeguards to prevent massive privacy breaches like the current scandal over Facebook and British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, MEPs from different political parties argued on Wednesday (18 April).


Responding to the campaign, a company spokesman said Facebook “is in a competitive environment where people use our apps at the same time they use free services offered by many others.”
The spokesman said in an emailed statement that “the average person uses eight different apps to communicate and stay connected.”
Chief executive and founder Mark Zuckerberg told a US congressional panel last month that it “doesn’t feel like” Facebook is a monopoly.
Facebook has an estimated two billion users worldwide, and its Messenger and Whatsapp messaging services each have more than one billion.
Any breakup would require a lengthy investigation by US authorities and a potentially long court battle as well.
The latest campaign was launched by the activist organisations Demand Progress, MoveOn, and SumOfUs, along with the groups Citizens Against Monopoly, Jewish Voice for Peace and Muslim Grassroots Movement.
It comes as Zuckerberg prepared to appear before European Parliament members to answer questions on the data scandal involving Cambridge Analytica, which obtained Facebook user data while working on the 2016 Donald Trump campaign.



Zuckerberg’s Parliament meeting ‘the right thing’, says EU justice chief
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s meeting on Tuesday afternoon (22 May) with European Parliament leaders is “the right thing for himself” after the company’s recent data collection scandal, EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova said in an interview.

                French President Emmanuel Macron has to make his political identity clear and clarify whether he is a “real progressive” who wants to contribute to a social Europe, S&D President Udo Bullmann told EURACTIV in an interview.
Udo Bullmann is the leader of the Social Democrats (S&D) in the European Parliament. He spoke to EURACTIV’s Sarantis Michalopoulos.  
INTERVIEW HIGHLIGHTS:
EU budget should prioritise the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Goals
Social Democrats should go back to their roots
The “Progressive” family cannot be governed by segmentation
Macron needs to live up to his pro-European ideals
There is no EU-wide move toward Macron’s movement
Europe needs a dialogue about double standards as well as a “new deal” between west and east
***
You launched the Progressive Society initiative with a specific agenda. Why now?
We are at a crossroads. Our societies are undergoing fundamental transformations and complex challenges – not only in Europe but also globally.
These transformations, such as climate change, digitalisation, and large-scale migration, require us to reconsider our model of societal development. If we fail to come up with the right answers, we will see yet more inequality and alienation.
The new approach we need to develop needs to be a holistic one. I am convinced that, in Europe as much as globally, we should put the UN 2030 Sustainable Development Goals at the core of our economic and social model. However, it does not stop there. We also need to change our way of communicating with people. The empowerment of people must be at the core of our political messages. In other words: The new paradigm needs to be a bottom-up approach. If you want people on the ground to organize and be part of a change, you need a forward-looking approach, which puts them at the core.
If you talk to people in theoretical language and about ‘a multitude of the economic, social and environmental issues’, no one is going to listen and understand. It often is too complicated. If you ask people questions they can relate to, though, you start engaging with them. ‘Why are poor kids being poisoned by diesel pollution? Why do low-income families not have access to quality food?’ You cannot talk about the economy without talking about employment. You cannot discuss employment without environmental issues. And you really cannot think of environmental challenges without considering their consequences for social inequality either.
Is the S&D moving closer to the left?
The Progressive Society initiative is an indication of the progressive character of our movement. We want to re-define how we can remain faithful to our roots. We have to be a modern movement; we have to identify the challenges of today to provide answers for tomorrow.
The story of social democracy has always been, and always will be, to empower people.
Are S&D doors open to green and leftist parties?
Our project is broad and we are ready for mutual understanding of what is progressive. Our objective is to re-connect with citizens’ initiatives, neighbourhoods and traditional trade unions.
We are leading the progressive family. This family cannot be governed by segmentation; it needs joint ideas.
When it was about changing the course of the financial markets legislation, we were building on a coalition of social democrats and Greens, but also intelligent conservatives who had a social consciousness and decided to be on the side of the SMEs against the big financial industries.
This bottom-up approach reminds me of French President Macron’s En Marche movement. Do you see room for cooperation?
We acknowledge that Macron did well in France in a very critical situation. There was a choice between nationalism and Europe. He made a great effort to put Europe at the core of his campaign and turned the page towards a pro-EU stance. This is a value in itself.
However, Macron now needs to live up to his pro-European ideals. It takes more than marching to the “Ode to Joy”. One cannot be in favour of a “Europe for all” on the one side and on the other oppose the work and life balance package proposed by the Commission. We ask Macron whether he is a real progressive and contributes to a social Europe or not.
There are French socialists who have already moved to Macron…
It hurts seeing comrades leaving our movement. But one also needs to acknowledge that the French situation is very special. I cannot see an EU-wide move toward that.
How did you see the Commission’s Multi-Annual Financial Framework (MFF) proposal? 
I see the problems and the difficulties of Mr Juncker and his team. The Brexit, the new challenges, etc.
At the end of the day, as a European Social Democrat, I have to define a benchmark. Juncker said ‘we are the Commission of the last chance’. I hoped, and I am still hoping, that the MFF proposal would live up to this promise.
For instance, we, as S&D Group, would argue for an approach where the UN Sustainable Development Goals are used as guidance for the reform of the budget. So, you can have cuts in big agricultural businesses, but not in small family farms or cohesion policy. I would really appreciate if we could adopt a systematic approach to developing our budget lines. That is where we can have a political debate on where we are going.
What’s your opinion about the proposed conditionality between EU funding and the rule of law in the next MFF?
Of course, all EU citizens have the right and deserve to see that laws are implemented properly. If the Commission is critical with countries that do not defend journalistic freedoms, the right of expression or independent justice, then the rule of law provision is not to punish governments, but to defend the people.
The EU is an entity that is founded on the rule of law and we have to defend it. One cannot say ‘I don’t care about the legal obligations but the money is mine.’
On the other hand, of course, we need dialogue about double standards. If you look at the complaints of Central and Eastern European countries about the food industry offering a different kind of quality under the same label, I fully understand their complaints. Why should these consumers accept less quality?
Central and Eastern European countries claim that they have almost 80% of the automotive industries’ productivity of the Western European factories. ‘Why do we only earn 30% of the wages? they wonder. There is a huge wage gap between the eastern and western economies. This is not fair.
I am advocating a new deal between west and east. Societies have to understand each other. This will help to strengthen common ideas for humane policies on refugees and migration.

                The EU said Tuesday (22 May) it will consider imposing new sanctions on Venezuela after Nicolas Maduro’s re-election was marred by “irregularities” and failed to meet international standards.
European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said in a statement that “the EU and its member states will consider the adoption of adequate measures” as a result of the vote.
The elections took place “without complying with the minimum international standards for a credible process, not respecting political pluralism, democracy, transparency and rule of law,” the statement said.
It also cited “major obstacles” to the Venezuelan opposition taking part, adding that “numerous reported irregularities during the election day, including vote buying, stood in the way of fair and equitable elections”.



EU says it may impose more sanctions on Venezuela if democracy undermined
The European Union said on Thursday it could impose further sanctions on Venezuela if it believes democracy is being undermined there, after the South American country’s president called for elections next month that the main opposition has said it will boycott.


The reaction from Brussels came after President Donald Trump ratcheted up the pressure on Maduro following what the United States called a “sham” election by tightening American sanctions on Caracas.
The EU had warned in April that it would consider further sanctions against Venezuela of its own if the elections were not fair.
In January Europe added seven senior Venezuelan officials including the interior minister to its sanctions blacklist, after hitting Caracas in November with an embargo on weapons and equipment that could be used for political repression.

                Belarus on Tuesday (22 May) appointed its first ambassador to Sweden for almost six years, resolving a bitter diplomatic spat over a pro-democracy stunt involving teddy bears.
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko appointed foreign ministry spokesman Dmitry Mironchik as the new ambassador to Sweden, his official website said.
The move ended hostile relations dating back to July 2012 when a group of Swedish activists parachuted teddy bears carrying pro-democracy messages into the ex-Soviet country.



Belarussian minister ousted in teddy bear crackdown
Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko has sacked his foreign minister following after a diplomatic row with Sweden and the European Union over a pro-democracy stunt in which hundreds of teddy bears were airdropped over the country.


Mironchik told Belarusian state television that “now we can say the Ice Age in relations between Belarus and Sweden has officially ended”.
Lukashenko was furious after activists managed to fly a small plane into Belarusian air space from Lithuania and drop some 800 toys, attached to little parachutes and holding signs calling for freedom of speech and human rights.
The Belarusian strongman, who has been in power since 1994, reacted by expelling Swedish diplomats and recalling Belarusian diplomats, although Belarus and Sweden never severed diplomatic ties.
Lukashenko also fired the foreign minister, the country’s top border control official and the air force commander. A border guard was jailed for failing to report the plane.
The European Union in 2016 lifted sanctions against Belarus for an improved human rights record, including the release of political prisoners.
Sweden in 2015 appointed an ambassador to Belarus.
The Belarusian move comes as the Swedish government on Monday presented a pamphlet on what households should do to prepare for possible war amid soaring tensions with Russia.



Belarus: Tensions with Sweden but no break with EU
Tensions between Belarus and the European Union are not new and follow a trend of increasing Belarussian alienation from the West. Although the dispute between Belarus and Sweden is the first these countries have had at such a high level, tensions are unlikely to grow since the West does not want to further isolate Belarus, argues Stratfor.

Such a scenario is difficult to imagine in the European Union or, for that matter, in any democratic country. Parliaments – the temples of democracy – are usually open to citizens, limited only by security measures.
But Poland has broken these principles, the building of its lower house, the Sejm, has been closed to citizens for a month now.



EU urges 'more progress' from Poland by next month
The EU warned Poland it could move closer next month to unprecedented sanctions, unless Warsaw makes “a lot more progress” in the row over its controversial court reforms.


This is how PiS, the party in power since 2015, reacted to another political crisis following the protest in a parliamentary corridor by 10 mothers of disabled children. The mothers and their children in wheelchairs visited the Sejm in mid-April, invited by one of the opposition MPs for a tour and visit of the building.
Instead, they stopped in one of the Sejm’s corridors, spread mattresses, pulled out improvised placards and began protesting. The Sejm’s security and the government were completely taken by surprise. A month has passed and the government is still helpless against the ongoing protest.
The protesting mothers demand a monthly payment of 500 Zloty (€116) for their children’s rehabilitation and medical equipment.



Raising awareness of disabilities through sporting Intégrathlon
Since 2009, the Intégrathlon has challenged preconceived ideas about disabilities with sports events organised in five towns in Seine-Saint-Denis. EURACTIV.fr went to Tremblay-en-France, one of the cities at the heart of this year’s project.


They argue that because the Polish economy is doing so well under the PiS government, with billions in the budget thanks to the tightening of the tax system and the government spending lavishly on things such as the promotion of patriotism and bonuses for ministers, there should be enough money for their children.
Though the protesters have met President Andrzej Duda and Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, their demands have not been heeded. As a result, the media controlled by the government have launched an unprecedented attack on the disabled and those supporting them, including Wanda Traczyk-Stawska, a 91-year veteran of the Home Army and participant of the 1944 Warsaw Uprising.
The media present them as puppets in the hands of the opposition. PiS politicians have also said that the mothers and their disabled children sleeping on mattresses in the Sejm corridors are a health hazard and should be removed by force.
When the protest began, the Marshal of the Sejm, Marek Kuchciński, announced the closure of the parliamentary building. This has affected journalists the most – only those with permanent Sejm passes are allowed into the building; those using one-time passes are turned away.
Kuchcinski’s thinking was probably that the fewer journalists there are to report on the protest, the better for his party. However, the media are not allowed to watch committee deliberations or meetings, and the work of the parliament – as the Constitution explicitly states – is public.
But as far as PiS is concerned, the constitution is not sacred, to put it mildly, and has been violated many times.
Experts invited to committee meetings are unable to enter the Sejm, important meetings have had to be cancelled and visitors are not allowed. Tours that have been arranged well in advance have been sent away unless they have been invited by one of the PiS MPs.
This means the Sejm will not host the parliament of children and young people on International Children’s Day (1 June), as it has done every year.



Polish government continues efforts to stifle free media
Press freedom is still under threat in Poland, the case of TVN24 journalist ,Wojciech Bojanowski ,who revealed a police torture case last year is one of the most striking examples of the Polish state’s control of the media. EURACTIV’s partner Gazeta Wyborcza reports.


Poland’s parliament resembles a beleaguered fortress. The building is fenced with police barricades, behind which police stand ready to stop anyone who might want to defy the Marshal’s ban.
More police will probably be deployed around the Sejm soon because the Marshal’s Guard, which protects the parliament, has recently been granted the right to use firearms, horses and armoured vehicles.
This is not the first time Marshall Kuchciński has imposed a blockade of the parliament.
In December 2016, Kuchciński decided to ban journalists from remaining in the Sejm and Senate. The opposition’s protest turned into a one-month blockade of the Sejm hall and major demonstrations outside the parliament, which was cordoned off by police.
The barriers and armed officers equipped with water cannons returned in the summer of 2017 to rein in protests against laws dismantling the independence of the Polish judiciary. But it turned out that the police were secretly monitoring opposition politicians. When Gazeta Wyborcza reported about it, the police said they were following the politicians for their own good.
But blocking the Sejm is not just about setting up a police cordon outside. Ever since Kuchciński came at the helm, the parliamentary debate has taken on a scandalous form. Work on key laws dealing with the PiS take-over of the Constitutional Tribunal, public media or common courts takes only a few days.
Discussions in committees are kept to the minimum, the voices of experts and the opposition are simply ignored and Kuchciński imposes fines on MPs who challenge this. The effects are deplorable. The new regulations need to be amended many times –  at the same pace.
Can you imagine such a set of perversions of democratic customs in the House of Commons, l’Assemblée Nationale, the Bundestag or the European Parliament?

                To some extent the vote next May will be a test of the resilience of the forces of disruption, the main achievement of whom so far being Brexit, writes Geoffrey Harris.
Geoffrey Harris is a former official of the European Parliament and currently visiting Professor at the College of Europe in Bruges.
Elections for the next European Parliament will take place a year from now. Inside the Brussels/Strasbourg bubble varying degrees of concern and expectation are already palpable. Two months after BREXIT, next May’s elections will take place in a context of explicit challenges to the authority of “Brussels” from many EU Member States with calls for, in effect, the reversal of the integration process.
Disruptive electoral forces have had a huge impact on national elections since 2014 and their impact on the next EP is likely to continue this process leading to a different parliamentary context for future EU decisions, not least in relation to selecting the leadership of all the institutions.
To some extent the vote next May will be a test of the resilience of the forces of disruption. Will Eurosceptic, populist advances in France, Austria and Italy be maintained? Will the apparently secular decline of social democratic parties seen in France, Germany and Italy as well as in central Europe be stopped or rolled back?
Will mainstream centre-right parties currently dominant in Brussels and Strasbourg reverse their losses in those three countries? Will the anti-Brussels governing parties in Hungary in Poland score new election victories? Will President Macron fall victim to electoral disillusionment or will his ambitious ideas and style catch the imagination of voters in other countries as has been the case with his allies in Ciudadanos in Spain?
Will he really be strong enough to challenge the overwhelming influence of the EPP and the Socialists and Democrats which together, despite changing fortunes, provided the stable pro-integration consensus which has enabled the European Parliament to continue what one leading academic described in July 2014 as its “unrelenting rise?”
Is democracy in Europe safe?
A few years ago, even at the time of the last EP elections of 2014 such a question might have seemed overly dramatic. May 2014 was the first EU parliamentary election held since the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, which had instituted political and institutional changes ostensibly designed to enhance the democratic legitimacy of the EU.
Ironically, neither the expanded powers of the European Parliament, nor its public information slogan of “this time it’s different” succeeded in mobilizing voters and instead, the downward trend in turnout continued with an abstention rate of nearly 58%. What was in fact different last time was the strong showing of radical right and anti-EU parties which gained a record number of seats. Indeed, without their mobilisation of voters the turnout in EP elections would have been even lower than ever.
In contrast to media characterizations of the election outcome as a “political earthquake” and a disaster for the European project, the consequences turned out to be less damaging than generally presumed by critics of the purported democratic deficit.
Sleepwalking to disaster?
President Macron in Strasbourg in April chose dramatic language about the current situation referring to the danger of civil war in Europe. His choice of words was, however, no more controversial than those of the current leaders of Poland and Hungary who openly defend the practice of illiberal democracy. The new Government in Italy seems likely to base its fragile unity on rejection of “interference” from Brussels.
The readiness of the current EU leadership to confront these challenges will be tested in the run-up to the EP elections. Will member states face down those opposing the rule of law linkage proposed in the MFF?
Will the Commission press on with legal action on Poland? Will the EP concerns on Hungary finally be acted upon? Will the EPP choice for Commission President take up these concerns or merely echo the emollient language of Joseph Daul and Manfred Weber?
If they are to recover enough credibility to challenge the right the Socialists in the EP also have to act upon concerns about the rule of law in Romania, Malta and Slovakia where their parties are in power.
Will the EU be able to function after May 2019?
Looking around the landscape of the European Union early in 2015, the casual observer may have wondered” what happened to the political earthquake announced around the time of the time of the May 2014 European Parliament elections?” Five years ago, there were dire predictions of a “self-hating Parliament…. a playground for populists.”
In fact, around 30% of seats in the current legislature went to various anti-EU or Eurosceptic parties. This did not, however, lead to a breakdown in the functioning of the EU in general or the European Parliament in particular.
Concerns that “business as usual” will be difficult a year from now may be seen in the sense of urgency around the Commission proposal for the post-Brexit long-term EU budget. This has to be agreed by the EP and (unanimously) by the member states.
The initial proposal is proving very controversial on many fronts ranging from cuts in CAP spending to conditionality of EU financial assistance in relation to respect for the rule of law. Politely described by Hungary as “blackmail” its chances of rapid adoption seem limited.
Some observers already fear an Italian scenario where in national elections in March a pro-European consensus which had lasted for nearly 70 years effectively evaporated.
The end of consensus politics.
The real difference now is that the end of the pro-EU consensus in many member states is leading to a blurring of the lines between the mainstream and the far right. When in 1984 Jean-Marie Le Pen scored an electoral breakthrough in the EP elections he was faced by an effective cordon sanitaire effectively marginalising him and his allies in Brussels and Strasbourg.
In January 1986 the EP adopted (286 votes to 1) a report on the rise of racism and fascism in Europe. Parliament established an initial consensus that such parties had to be confronted and, in the decades, since then the EU has taken legislative action to confront both racism and xenophobia.
Article 7 of the Lisbon Treaty may be seen as part of the ongoing efforts to equip the EU to confront extremism and threats to democracy. Debates on such subjects in the EP are, however, no longer consensual. The cordon sanitaire no longer exists.
In Austria the party from Marine Le Pen’s EP Group is in the Government. In Italy her ally is in a very strong position precisely because it went into the recent election in alliance with an EPP Party Forza Italia the party of Mr Berlusconi and current EP President Tajani.
The winning party in the recent Italian election works together with UKIP in a separate explicitly Eurosceptic group. Marine Le Pen has been encouraging Orbán to take his party out of the EPP and join hers.
As EPP EP Group Chair Weber was congratulating Orbán the S&D and ALDE Group Chairmen were denouncing him and pressing the Commission to act. Within the EPP Party lively discussions are reportedly ongoing as to how to deal with what Joseph Daul kindly describes as their “enfant terrible.”
Apparently not terrible enough to restrain the respected and experienced EPP Party Chair from wishing Orbán good luck in advance of his election.
So, when the EP reconvenes after next May’s elections the chances of effective cooperation between the main EP Groups may be more limited than in 2014. For the moment all continue to insist on respecting the Spitzenkandidaten process but with threats to the basic values of the EU apparent even within both the main groups it is far from clear how this will work in practice.
Indeed, the friendly debates between Juncker and Schulz in 2014 reflected the integrationist consensus which is being so openly challenged across the continent.
Within hours of the 2014 EP election results being known the runner-up Martin Schulz and his party allies plumped for a grand coalition but as perceived by former EP Secretary General, Julian Priestley and his co-author (The Making of a European President, Palgrave 2015), the socialists found themselves locked into a parliamentary majority, but with the perception that their influence is negligible and incapable of mobilising their supporters in 2019.
Describing the 2014 EP elections as “issue light”, Priestley raised the question already of whether “an EPP/PES majority, already slender in 2014, might be completely insufficient in 2019 to sustain the next Commission.”
As that parliamentary coalition does not currently exist the outlook is even more uncertain.
Right Moving right and left moving left?
Part of the reason that the social democrats look with concern to the next election is that they also fear that as in France, Greece and the Netherlands they could lose out to left-wing parties calling for a change of course on management of the Eurozone.
Meanwhile, some analysts consider that the EPP leaders’ response to developments in central Europe will lead, in fact, to an Orbánization of the EPP. Without explicitly adopting the language of Euroscepticism it does appear that party leaders like Laurent Wauquiez in France and Horst Seehofer in Germany are ready to adopt some of the language and anti-Brussels rhetoric of identity politics. As immigration and the future of Schengen could be big issues in the 2019 EP elections it seems that such leaders consider that their approach is the smart way of recouping electoral losses to the far right.
The danger is, however, that their rivals on the right can see them coming. On 1 May Marine Le Pen who is counting on an electoral success next May brought together he European allies in Marseilles. Like those on the far left, her message is no longer about leaving the Euro let alone FREXIT but is now about being for Europe but against Brussels and certainly against the further integration being championed by President Macron her 2017 nemesis. Her language is hardly very different from that of Wauquiez who describes the EU as a rêve perdu. Indeed, already in 2014, he was writing about France exiting Schengen.
Domesticating the opponents
It remains to be seen if the Commission will find a diplomatic solution to the overt challenge to EU values emerging in Hungary and Poland. This, in effect, blunts the impact of position adopted by the European Parliament which is precisely why the anti-Brussels revolutionaries in power in Warsaw and Budapest are ready to negotiate whilst rejecting (along with others) the values element in the MFF which, anyway, will not be effective until well after the next EP elections.
Listening to the critics, but no surrender
For too long the mainstream parties at EU level ignored the Eurosceptics, assuming that what is marginal, as the far right was in the 1980s, is also insignificant. Instead it would have been wiser to reflect upon what the “anti-system” forces had to say. Assuming that political issues could be overcome merely by better non-political communication on behalf of the system has proved naive.
A very different European Parliament after 2019 
Hans-Gert Pottering led the efforts leading to the EPP becoming the strongest group in the EP after 1999. He considered that there was nothing inevitable about the situation in which since 1979 “the EPP Group had always played second fiddle to the Socialist Group in Parliament.” At the time British Conservatives were part of the EPP group but as President Pottering explains in his fascinating autobiography (United for the Better-My European Way John Harper 2016) it was the integration of the mainstream right parties from France and Italy which really changed things.
The change in the power balance did not, however, undermine the ability of the two main groups to cooperate to advance the interests of the institutions and to ensure the continuing integration process. With so many EPP parties now ready to work at national and indeed local level with far-right parties it is very hard to see such a consensus re-emerging any time soon.
So once the dust settles on the post BREXIT EU and as the Union tries to face down the aggressive approaches from Moscow and Washington Europe’s voters will be decoding whether BREXIT has brought about a miraculously more united Europe or whether that first disruptive event was just an ice-breaker, the beginning of an era of disruption.

                Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday (24 May) that his country appreciated efforts by Europe to save the Iran nuclear deal despite the withdrawal of the United States and warned of “lamentable consequences” if it was not preserved.
Putin made the comment in a news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron, offering some support for the French leader’s plan for negotiating a broader agreement with Tehran to cover Iran’s ballistics program and its activities in the Middle East.



Macron and Putin: 'Frenemies' reunited
With relations between the West and Russia at historic lows, French President Emmanuel Macron travels to St Petersburg Thursday to seek common ground with Russian President Vladimir Putin.


Macron met Putin seeking to win concessions on Syria, Iran and Ukraine after returning largely empty-handed from a state visit to the United States.
“Certainly we can discuss Iran’s ballistic missiles. We can discuss Iran’s policies in the Middle East and its nuclear activities after 2025,” Putin said.
“But we cannot make preserving the Iranian nuclear deal dependent on these three parameters because if we do, it means that we too are withdrawing from the accord because the deal that exists foresees no additional conditions.”
A Macron adviser hailed Putin’s comments as a “key” point of convergence between Paris and Moscow as the Trump administration urges its European allies to sever economic ties with Iran.
After talks that ran long over schedule, Macron and Trump entered the news conference looking relaxed and smiling. Macron acknowledged Paris and Moscow disagreed on a range of issues but called for “strong multilateralism”.
Earlier, it was announced French energy major Total would buy a 10% stake in a Russian Arctic gas project, showing the Kremlin’s ability to find foreign partners despite Western sanctions.
“I hope Russia understands France is a credible and trustworthy European partner,” Macron said.



EU energy chief courts Iran after Trump's withdrawal from nuclear deal
Europe’s energy and climate chief sought to reassure Iran’s top ministers on Saturday (19 May) that the European Union wants to keep trade open despite the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal.


At odds over Syria
As Macron spoke at length, Putin’s eyes frequently drifted towards the ceiling, his brow slightly furrowed.
There were few signs Macron succeeded in shifting Putin’s stance over Syria, where Russian and Iranian military support for President Bashar al-Assad over the past three years has allowed Assad to crush the rebel threat to topple him.
The two men agreed on creating a coordination mechanism among world powers to push ahead with finding a political solution in Syria, and that the focus should be on a new constitution and setting up elections that would include all Syrians.
“We need to be talking about the situation after the war. The key is to build a stable Syria,” Macron said.
But he won no clear backing from his Russian counterpart for an international body that would attribute responsibility for chemical weapons attacks.
France, together with the United States and Britain conducted a missile attack against the heart of Syria’s chemical weapons program in mid-April in retaliation for a suspected poison gas attack a week earlier.



Putin predicts global 'chaos' if West hits Syria again
Russian President Vladimir Putin warned on Sunday (15 April) that further Western attacks on Syria would bring chaos to world affairs, as Washington prepared to increase pressure on Russia with new economic sanctions.


Addressing North Korea, both men said they hoped the United States and North Korea would continue working towards denuclearizing the Korean peninsula after U.S. President Donald Trump called off a planned summit.
Macron said he hoped Trump’s move “was just a glitch in a process that should be continued.”
Human rights 
Macron said he met the head of Russia’s oldest rights group as well as the widow of Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the Nobel literature laureate and prominent dissident of the Soviet era.
Facing calls at home to send a signal on human rights and democratic values to the Russian leader during his visit, Macron posted pictures on Thursday night of his meeting with the head of the Memorial rights group, Alexander Cherkasov.

As the first non-governmental organization registered in the Soviet Union, Memorial is a symbol of the fight for democracy and human rights in Russia.
It is now one of hundreds of NGOs under scrutiny for receiving funding from abroad and involvement in what is loosely defined as “political activities.”
“Memorial is really the symbol of a democratic Russia that is brutalised by the authorities. Macron can show that Russia, for him, is not only its leaders but also its civil society,” French philosopher Michel Eltchaninoff told Reuters.
Macron also posted on Twitter a video of his meeting with Solzhenitsyn’s widow, Natalia Solzhenitsyn, whom he called “the echo of a voice that marked the 20th century and continues to shine in ours.”

Long banned at home, Alexander Solzhenitsyn gained fame when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev allowed the publication in 1962 of his “One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich”, which described the horrifying routine of labor-camp life.
He won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1970 for his work, including “The Gulag Archipelago”, a chronicle of his own and thousands of other prison-camp experiences.
His books unveiled the dark secrets of the Gulag network of camps where millions of Russians died during Stalin’s purges. Some read and distributed his books underground, defying state persecution.
After Solzhenitsyn’s return following his expulsion from the country, the post-Soviet leadership paid him much respect. But he became increasingly critical of the state of modern-day Russia, denouncing corruption.

                Spain’s main opposition Socialist Party tabled on Friday (25 May) a motion of no confidence in Parliament against the government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy after his ruling Popular Party was found guilty of corruption in a court verdict. EURACTIV’s partner efe-epa reports.
Socialist Party leader Pedro Sánchez said the verdict, which was published in a National Court statement on Thursday, made it necessary to table the motion and trigger a vote of no-confidence in the government.
The court ruled that the Popular Party and some of its former officials were guilty of fraudulent financial dealings

— Pedro Sánchez (@sanchezcastejon) May 25, 2018

“The verdict has unleashed a constitutional crisis of extreme gravity on the country,” Sánchez told a press conference in the party’s Madrid headquarters.
Rajoy responded by appearing at a press conference in his official residence, Moncloa Palace, and said the motion was harmful to the stability of Spain.
“This motion is bad for Spain, bad for Spaniards, it introduces a great deal of uncertainty and is harmful to the future of all citizens,” he said.
The Socialists do not have enough votes in Parliament to carry the motion, so they will need the support of other parties to end Rajoy’s conservative government, which also does not have an absolute majority.
The court ruling also cast doubt on the trustworthiness of testimony given by Rajoy, the Popular Party’s leader, Rajoy, who said in court in July that he knew nothing of any wrongdoing.



Secret payments scandal weighs on Spanish PM Rajoy
Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and Spain's ruling People's Party denied today (31 January) that the party passed payments from business donors secretly to the premier and other party leaders after a newspaper published what it said were unofficial party accounts.


“The witnesses do not have sufficient credibility to refute the evidence,” the court judgment said, agreeing with Spain’s state prosecution in casting doubt on the testimonies given to magistrates by party officials, including Rajoy.
Former secretaries-general of the Popular Party, Javier Arenas and Francisco Álvarez Cascos, as well as Rajoy, had testified that detailed notes, made by a former party treasurer, “lacked credibility.”
The court handed down jail sentences to various people linked to the party, including one of its former treasurers, Luis Bárcenas, who is set to serve 33 years in prison.



Spain’s Rajoy refuses to resign as graft scandal unfolds
Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy yesterday (15 July) rejected calls to resign over a financing scandal in his ruling centre-right People's Party, saying he would not allow the matter to hold back his reform plans.


According to the Spanish Constitution, the motion of no confidence must have the absolute majority in Parliament to succeed.
There are 350 lawmakers in Spain’s lower chamber. The Socialists (PSOE) only have 85 seats, so they will have to negotiate with other opposition parties to reach the 176 votes necessary to oust Rajoy, who governs with the parliamentary support of Ciudadanos, a centre-right party.
The Socialists will have the support of Unidos Podemos (67 seats), and could also have the support of small parties of the left and Catalan separatists.
The motion of no confidence was demanded by Pablo Iglesias, the leader of left-wing Podemos party, on Thursday after the court verdict became known.

He said the court ruling proved that Rajoy was in charge of “a delinquent party.”
This will be the second time Rajoy, who has been in government since 2011, faces a motion of no confidence.
Iglesias already filed a motion of no confidence against Rajoy a year ago but did not get enough parliamentary votes for it to prosper.
In 40 years of democracy, three other motions of no confidence have  been tabled in Parliament, once against the government of Adolfo Suárez and one against Felipe González, before a brace against Rajoy.

                Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy is a natural born survivor, literally. He almost lost his life twice, first in a car accident in 1979, and years later in a helicopter crash in 2005. But in terms of his political career, he may not be so lucky a third time.
The leader who lost two general elections before becoming Spanish prime minister also survived an attempt to oust him as the leader of the Popular Party (PP) in 2008, orchestrated by former leader Jose Maria Aznar and his Praetorian guard.
Rajoy got to power months before Spain was forced to request international aid to save its ailing banking system. When the economy was getting out of the woods, he had to handle (very poorly) the Catalan issue, the most serious institutional crisis since the country returned to democracy.
But his survival instincts and his longstanding problem-solving strategy of just letting time pass is hardly going to cut it this time around.
That’s because the quiet Galician faces the judicial consequences of the most serious corruption case in the history of Spain. The so-called Gürtel case has hit the party he managed and presided over since 2003, right at its heart.
An historic court sentence released yesterday concluded that an organisation established “a structure of stable cooperation” with the PP in order to deploy “an authentic and efficient system of institutional corruption” to grant national, regional and local contracts. The network represented a parallel source of illegal funding for the party.
The judges even questioned the “credibility” of Rajoy’s testimony during the court proceedings, when he denied he received payments from the ‘slush fund’ financed with corrupt money.
The court ruling destroyed the PP and Rajoy’s line of defence. Over the past years, the party leadership always said that the numerous corruption cases affecting their elected members in Madrid and Valencia, their two main strongholds, were “isolated cases”.
The sentence brings an end to the PP’s firm belief in their impunity. Their victories in consecutive national and regional elections were interpreted as citizens’ forgiveness for past sins.
While some of the court cases continue (the ruling on the ‘slush fund’ is still pending) the political consequences escalated over the past few hours.
The Socialist Party submitted a no-confidence vote. Ciudadanos, a liberal party with the fourth largest number of seats, said that it would submit its own initiative if Rajoy does not call for snap elections.  A majority of the groups already expressed their intention to vote against the embattled prime minister.
On Friday, Rajoy missed the last opportunity to show a glimpse of dignity by resigning. He stuck to his guns and warned that the attempts to oust him “go against stability, so badly needed today”. And blamed Pedro Sanchez, the Socialist leader, of aiming for the leadership “at any cost”
But the survivor is running out of lifelines. Rajoy may try to discredit the alternatives but he cannot steal from Spaniards the right to have a clean government, and the means to elect one.
It remains to be seen how soon it could be. Ciudadanos, who is leading the polls, does not want to support Sanchez’s vote and is pushing for a joint effort to strong-arm Rajoy to call for snap elections.
Sanchez said that if he wins the vote (and accordingly becomes prime minister) he would call for snap elections. But he did not say when.
As a result, Spanish voters could face once of the most politically intense periods in years. The country would celebrate local, regional and European elections in May 2019, and the Catalan crisis remains to be solved.
This period of instability in the fourth largest economy comes at the worst moment for Europe. The bloc is already teetering after the election of a populist government in Italy, just when the Union faces a crucial period (Brexit and EU budget talks, eurozone reform, EU-US trade dispute etc).
Investors are wary of the Italian consequences, and the risk of contagion is already materialising in the Spanish and Portuguese debt.
Spain came a long way and now it is the fastest growing economy among the big ones in Europe. But “vulnerabilities” (high debt and unemployment) of “crossborder relevance” remain, the European Commission said this week.
While the political storm unfolds and the economic impact (hopefully) is contained, the good news for some is that the institutions worked well in Spain.
“The most reassuring part” is that “courts are working and we have to be happy about it,” said Eurogroup president Mario Centeno on Thursday.
As the Spanish judges came under the spotlight during the Catalan crisis, the sentence brings some hope to trust the system if the faith is lost in our leaders.

                Italy’s president is expected to ask a former International Monetary Fund official today (28 May) to head a stopgap government amidst political and constitutional turmoil, with early elections looking inevitable.
Looking to allay investor concerns, Mattarella vetoed on Sunday the choice of 81-year-old economist Paolo Savona, a vocal critic of the single currency, to the pivotal economy post.
Prime Minister-designate Giuseppe Conte promptly abandoned his efforts to form a government.



Italian president hesitates as novice put forward as premier
Italy’s anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the far-right League on Monday (21 May) proposed Giuseppe Conte, a little-known law professor, as prime minister to lead their big-spending coalition government.


In a sombre, televised speech, Mattarella said he had accepted all the suggested ministers bar Savona.
“I asked for that ministry an authoritative political figure from the coalition parties who was not seen as the supporter of a line that could provoke Italy’s exit from the euro,” he said.
Shortly afterwards, he summoned former International Monetary Fund (IMF) senior official Carlo Cottarelli for a Monday morning meeting — an indication he may be considering asking him to head a government of unelected technocrats.

“The uncertainty over our position has alarmed investors and savers both in Italy and abroad,” he said, adding: “Membership of the euro is a fundamental choice. If we want to discuss it, then we should do so in a serious fashion.”

Financial markets tumbled last week on fears the coalition being discussed would unleash a spending splurge and dangerously ramp up Italy’s already huge debt, which is equivalent to more than 1.3 times the nation’s domestic output.
After Mattarella’s move, the euro gained ground, adding 0.6% against the Japanese yen and ticking up against other major trading partners as well.
The far-right League and anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, which had spent days drawing up a coalition pact aimed at ending a stalemate following an inconclusive March vote, responded with fury to Mattarella, accusing him of abusing his office.

5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio called on parliament to impeach the mild-mannered Mattarella, while League chief Matteo Salvini threatened mass protests unless snap elections were called.
“If there’s not the OK of Berlin, Paris or Brussels, a government cannot be formed in Italy. It’s madness, and I ask the Italian people to stay close to us because I want to bring democracy back to this country,” Salvini told reporters.


Impeachment of President Mattarella? The demand by the M5S & League is so far-fetched that shouldn't be taken seriously. This is foreseen only for high-treason betrayal constitution & requires absolute majority of both chambers #iTALY2018 #Mattarella #Impeachment pic.twitter.com/EsmhaNazHb

Short-term solution
While he had approved all their other ministerial picks, Mattarella said he had the right to block nominations that could harm the country. He added that the League and 5-Star had refused to put forward any other name for the role.
Shortly afterwards, the president’s office summoned Cottarelli, the IMF’s former director of fiscal affairs, for a meeting on Monday. Such a call is usually a prelude to being offered a mandate to form a government.
Cottarelli would be a calming choice for the financial markets, but any technocratic administration would likely only be a short-term solution because the majority of parliamentarians have said they would not support such a government.
If, as expected, he fails to win parliamentary backing, Cottarelli would simply ferry Italy to elections that would most likely be held in September or October. It would be the first time in postwar Italian history that such a re-vote was needed.
Polls have suggested that the League, which won 17% of the vote in March, would surge in any early ballot, while support for 5-Star remained strong on around 35%.
Mainstream centre-left and centre-right parties were seen losing further ground in the face of voter anger over the sluggish economy, high unemployment and rising poverty.
‘Foreign pressure’
Demanding an immediate ballot, Salvini told followers on Facebook: “It won’t be an election, it will be a referendum between Italy and those on the outside who want us to be a servile, enslaved nation on our knees.”

Salvini declined, however, to be drawn on whether he would back calls by 5-Star and a far-right ally, the Brothers of Italy, to chase Mattarella out of office.
“We will ask parliament to charge Mattarella with high treason because he has acted under foreign pressure,” Brothers of Italy chief Giorgia Meloni said on La7 television channel.
The 5-Star’s Di Maio demanded impeachment under article 90 of the constitution. Under that clause, parliament can seek to remove a president if a simple majority of lawmakers votes in favour. The constitutional court would then be called to decide whether to enforce the decision.

The centre-right Forza Italia party and the centre-left Democratic Party (PD) both denounced calls for impeachment, with former PD leader Matteo Renzi saying his party would take to the streets to defend Italy’s institutions if needed.
“Today, we need people to say ‘no’ to those who want to break us apart, who make excuses rather than assuming their responsibilities, who are playing on the anxieties of others,” Renzi, a former prime minister, wrote on Facebook.

                Some 5,000 supporters of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) marched through the streets of Berlin on Sunday (27 May), but they were heavily outnumbered by anti-AfD demonstrations.
The AfD’s anti-immigration, anti-European Union and anti-Muslim messages helped it become the third largest party in the German Bundestag in last September’s vote but it has had little impact on parliamentary debate since then.
The AfD demonstrators, bussed in from around Germany, marched from Berlin’s main station, down the banks of the Spree river to the Brandenburg Gate near the German parliament.


Berlin was treated the surreal spectacle of the Brandenburg Gate once again serving to demarcate two Germanys.

But there were around 20,000 anti-AfD protesters – according to police estimates – most of them younger people, highlighting the divisions that have emerged in Germany since the 2015 refugee crisis.
The AfD supporters, mostly older, waved German and AfD flags and carried placards demanding “Democracy not Merkelatorship.”
Senior AfD lawmaker Beatrix von Storch, who addressed the supporters as they set off from the central station, said: “The rule of Islam in Germany is the rule of evil.”
Berliners responded with at least 13 registered counter-demonstrations. These included one by the city’s club scene, which put on a techno music party, aiming to “Bass the AfD away” with music blasting from speakers on 20 public address trucks.

The AfD is now the largest opposition party following the deal between Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives and the Social Democrats to renew their grand coalition.
As a result, the AfD, founded as an anti-European Union party by a group of academics in 2013, has a host of powerful committee chairmanships, but has so far failed to capitalise on them.
Sunday’s protests were broadly peaceful, with only one minor injury reported amid a heavy police presence.

                Azerbaijan’s Ambassador to Belgium, Fuad Isgandarov, talks about the current geopolitical tensions with Iran, recent political changes in Armenia, attacks against his country in  the international media, the human rights situation and future EU relations.
Fuad Isgandarov previously served as Ambassador to the Netherlands, and as an ambassador-at-large. He also served as Deputy Minister of Azerbaijan’s Ministry of National Security. 
Isgandarov spoke to EURACTIV’s Senior Editor, Georgi Gotev.
Your minister of foreign affairs Elmar Mammadyarov was in Brussels recently, he met with EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini. Did they discuss Iran and Armenia as well?
Of course, European partners have shown strong interest to our position concerning the latest changes in implementation of the nuclear deal with Iran. The position of Azerbaijan on this matter is absolutely clear. Our cooperation with our Iranian neighbours has started much earlier than that agreement.
We do have cooperation with Iran in trade, implementation of energy, transportation and water management projects. They started not because of the nuclear deal but as a result of “good neighbourhood” policy with all bordering countries except Armenia, which occupies 20% of Azerbaijani territory. As you see we are in good neighbourly relations with both EU and Iran. I think it really works for security and stability of the region.
Concerning the situation in Armenia we did refrain from commenting on domestic developments in this country. The only aspect we were interested in, was about the possibility to advance peaceful settlement of the Armenia-Azerbaijan Nagorno-Karabakh conflict [Nagorno-Karabakh and 7 adjacent regions are internationally recognized territories of Azerbaijan, but occupied by Armenia] in accordance with international law and relevant UN Security Council Resolutions.
The previous government made its survival through its radical destructive policy towards conflict settlement. The current Armenian government is facing the debris of this policy. They need “fresh air” and “fresh blood” to revive the economy which is in a shambles. They should strive to become an inclusive partner in projects in the region. This is possible only through building normal relations with neighbouring countries.
But with the new leadership in Yerevan can we be optimistic?
Unfortunately, so far the new leadership’s actions and behaviour in handling conflict issues have been far from inspiring optimism. In his early days of office, the Prime Minister went to the occupied Nagorno-Karabakh region to celebrate the anniversary of occupation of Shusha, a city where ethnic Azerbaijanis constituted an overwhelming majority. There he voiced controversial statements about “annexing Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia” and introducing new “conflict parties” to the negotiation format which did not fit into the context and substance of negotiations mediated by the OSCE Minsk Group. There is no need to reinvent the wheel.
The new leadership’s aggressive rhetoric was followed by a military provocation at the Azerbaijan-Armenia state border where an Azerbaijani soldier was shot dead in Nakhchivan.
In the meantime, on the other side of the conflict, soon after his re-appointment Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov met OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairs in Paris where he reiterated Azerbaijan’s interest in pushing ahead substantial negotiations.
So, you can see differences between these two approaches. Continuing aggressive actions and rhetoric on the one hand, and a constructive approach on the other. I hope the international community will adequately assess it.
Do you think that the EU has to step in to ease the tension between parties? 
The European Union is not involved in the settlement of the conflict. But this does not prevent the EU from promoting and international law-based solution to the conflict and supporting the territorial integrity, sovereignty, independence and inviolability of internationally recognized borders of partner countries which were identified as key principles of European security in the EU’s Global Strategy. We appreciate and value the EU’s explicit and consistent position in supporting these principles in its relations with Azerbaijan. Unlike Armenia, Azerbaijan does not intend to drag conflict settlement issues into the EU landscape. Nor does it follow Armenia’s notorious practice to use every occasion within the EU institutions in order to manipulate conflict language for internal consumption. Azerbaijan’s relations with the EU are much broader and serious in content and cover far-reaching objectives.
You mean relations progress well? 
Yes. We welcomed the €2.5 billion EIB financing of TAP and TANAP which has materialized the EU’s strategic approach to the energy partnership with Azerbaijan. It is a measure of the success of all involved that the first gas from Azerbaijan will be delivered to Turkey this summer already, and that it should arrive in Europe as of 2020. We will welcome Commissioner Gunther Oettinger in Baku in the coming days in the margins of the Caspian International Oil and Gas Conference, to whom we pay a big tribute for his valuable contributions to the realization of the Southern Gas Corridor in his previous capacity of EU Energy Commissioner.
We are seriously engaged with the EU in further developing connectivity concept in the region by capitalizing on the realization of tangible transport projects. As testified by Commissioner Johannes Hahn, Azerbaijan is very well placed to play a key role in linking Europe and Asia. We are also glad to hear that the European Union will continue to support the Port of Baku in becoming an international logistics and trade hub.



Ziyadov: Baku will become a Dubai-like hub in Eurasia
Azerbaijan intends to build a major trading hub close to its capital as a tax-free zone, with the expectation that other countries in the region will replicate the example and give a boost to the entire Eurasia region, Taleh Ziyadov told EURACTIV.com in an exclusive interview.


We are eager to build on pragmatic and positive outcomes in our relations with the EU by reflecting on our ongoing negotiations on a new comprehensive agreement between Azerbaijan and the EU. The pace of negotiations on different chapters may vary but this does not question our objective to achieve a good agreement rather than a speedy one.
I see more and more negative articles about Azerbaijan, the whole “laundromat series” for example. What is your comment? 
They are totally orchestrated, organized and synchronized. It started with campaigns about human rights, then went to corruption. And now we even see deliberate provocations to make references to Azerbaijan within coverage about some murders on the territories of different EU member states. Can you imagine, that the country being artificially cited, is the one that suffered from dozens of terrorist attacks in the beginning of the nineties, as a result of which approximately 2,000 people lost their lives?! Despite the occupation of an important part of country’s territory, Azerbaijan has never resorted to terrorist attacks against civilians in reaction to this occupation. Moreover, Azerbaijan is one of the most reliable partners in the international antiterrorist coalition, having the strong background of cooperation in this sphere, which is highly valued by the EU, NATO and other partners.
This fake news is coming from the same media sources, the same newspapers, the same authors. I am convinced that all these attempts are doomed to failure.
But what is their interest?
My country is very serious at developing, it is actively engaged in major regional and European processes. We are going to Europe with a €47 billion project [the Southern Gas Corridor] – which is going to connect Europe with Asia and become, together with our neighbours, Georgia, Turkey, the Central Asian countries, the main transportation hub connecting Asia and Europe, the role of the country is really increasing…
So someone wants to prevent bigger projects in Azerbaijan by de-stabilizing Azerbaijan?
In any case, it aims at creating a negative image of the country and to separate it from the regional and European processes. Recently we saw the same attempts in the Council of Europe. We all witnessed that some circles in Europe rushed to congratulate Serge Sargsyan with the “successful” conduct of the parliamentary elections in Armenia. Ironically, right after the population forced him to resign as the prime minister chosen by this very parliament. But in the case of Azerbaijan, despite the completely biased statements, including the one by ODIHR on recent presidential elections, full public confidence toward country’s leadership continues to remain unchanged.
We still regret the continuous double standards manifested by the European Parliament side as well, despite inter-parliamentary links between EU and Azerbaijan recently starting to progress. For instance, we noted two press releases at the official European Parliament website concerning reports on EU agreements with Azerbaijan and Armenia voted recently in  the Foreign Affairs committee. Although the documents were similar in nature and content, the headlines of the press releases were enough to expose obvious bias concerning my country. That is about the question who is lobbying in the EU institutions.
But the response from your side could go in two directions. One, which is visible, is creating big economic hubs, like the port of Baku. Secondly, your country can do much more to improve the human rights and media freedom situation so that such accusations will not be credible. 
The process of building transportation hubs has just started. We saw similar, even much harsher attempts to impede our energy projects, when we started them in the nineties. But despite all attempts we managed to make them happen. I am sure that the success story of Azerbaijan in the implementation of current energy and transportation projects will be repeated on a qualitatively new level.
Concerning democracy and human rights. You know, today we are celebrating the 100th anniversary of the first parliamentary democratic republic of the Muslim East. [The Azerbaijan Democratic Republic proclaimed its independence in 1918 and became the first democratic state in the Muslim-oriented world.] Even one hundred years ago Azerbaijan was a democratic country, there was a government where different nations, ethnic groups were represented. There was a parliament with participation of Azerbaijanis, Russians, Germans, Poles, Ukrainians, Jews, Armenians, and Georgians. The parliament adopted women’s right to vote much earlier than most of European countries. And if you think that we do not have this tradition, well, we do. But the problem is that democracy is a complex issue. Today, the level of democracy in Azerbaijan is much higher than it was before. But keeping in mind specific elements of the regional situation, we should be consistent, but also careful in gradual liberalization of society without leaving any room for abusing those democratic liberties against the European values themselves. We have to be strong in order to duly protect these liberties.

Do you make an allusion to foreign interference? 
Azerbaijan is not facing serious problems coming from inside of its society. But challenges from outside of the country are really serious. Especially now – in today’s turbulent world. The choice for Azerbaijan, which is located at the crossroads of the civilizations, is obvious: to become a new battlefield, new frontline or new conflict zone, as happened in too many countries of this part of the world, or to be engaged in creating a new map of connectivity of nations, cultures, economies, religions, countries and ,of course, peoples. We prefer the second option. In this unpredictable world, bridge constructors are more needed than their destroyers.

Did they discuss Iran and Armenia as well? Of course, European partners have shown strong interest to our position concerning the latest changes in implementation of the nuclear deal with Iran. The position of Azerbaijan on this matter is absolutely clear. Our cooperation with our Iranian neighbours has started much earlier than that agreement. We do have cooperation with Iran in trade, implementation of energy, transportation and water management projects. They started not because of the nuclear deal but as a result of “good neighbourhood” policy with all bordering countries except Armenia, which occupies 20% of Azerbaijani territory. As you see we are in good neighbourly relations with both EU and Iran. I think it really works for security and stability of the region. Concerning the situation in Armenia we did refrain from commenting on domestic developments in this country. The only aspect we were interested in, was about the possibility to advance peaceful settlement of the Armenia-Azerbaijan Nagorno-Karabakh conflict [Nagorno-Karabakh and 7 adjacent regions are internationally recognized territories of Azerbaijan, but occupied by Armenia] in accordance with international law and relevant UN Security Council Resolutions. The previous government made its survival through its radical destructive policy towards conflict settlement. The current Armenian government is facing the debris of this policy. They need “fresh air” and “fresh blood” to revive the economy which is in a shambles. They should strive to become an inclusive partner in projects in the region. This is possible only through building normal relations with neighbouring countries. But with the new leadership in Yerevan can we be optimistic? Unfortunately, so far the new leadership’s actions and behaviour in handling conflict issues have been far from inspiring optimism. In his early days of office, the Prime Minister went to the occupied Nagorno-Karabakh region to celebrate the anniversary of occupation of Shusha, a city where ethnic Azerbaijanis constituted an overwhelming majority. There he voiced controversial statements about “annexing Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia” and introducing new “conflict parties” to the negotiation format which did not fit into the context and substance of negotiations mediated by the OSCE Minsk Group. There is no need to reinvent the wheel. The new leadership’s aggressive rhetoric was followed by a military provocation at the Azerbaijan-Armenia state border where an Azerbaijani soldier was shot dead in Nakhchivan. In the meantime, on the other side of the conflict, soon after his re-appointment Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov met OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairs in Paris where he reiterated Azerbaijan’s interest in pushing ahead substantial negotiations. So, you can see differences between these two approaches. Continuing aggressive actions and rhetoric on the one hand, and a constructive approach on the other. I hope the international community will adequately assess it. Do you think that the EU has to step in to ease the tension between parties? The European Union is not involved in the settlement of the conflict. But this does not prevent the EU from promoting and international law-based solution to the conflict and supporting the territorial integrity, sovereignty, independence and inviolability of internationally recognized borders of partner countries which were identified as key principles of European security in the EU’s Global Strategy. We appreciate and value the EU’s explicit and consistent position in supporting these principles in its relations with Azerbaijan. Unlike Armenia, Azerbaijan does not intend to drag conflict settlement issues into the EU landscape. Nor does it follow Armenia’s notorious practice to use every occasion within the EU institutions in order to manipulate conflict language for internal consumption. Azerbaijan’s relations with the EU are much broader and serious in content and cover far-reaching objectives. You mean relations progress well? Yes. We welcomed the €2.5 billion EIB financing of TAP and TANAP which has materialized the EU’s strategic approach to the energy partnership with Azerbaijan. It is a measure of the success of all involved that the first gas from Azerbaijan will be delivered to Turkey this summer already, and that it should arrive in Europe as of 2020. We will welcome Commissioner Gunther Oettinger in Baku in the coming days in the margins of the Caspian International Oil and Gas Conference, to whom we pay a big tribute for his valuable contributions to the realization of the Southern Gas Corridor in his previous capacity of EU Energy Commissioner. We are seriously engaged with the EU in further developing connectivity concept in the region by capitalizing on the realization of tangible transport projects. As testified by Commissioner Johannes Hahn, Azerbaijan is very well placed to play a key role in linking Europe and Asia. We are also glad to hear that the European Union will continue to support the Port of Baku in becoming an international logistics and trade hub. Ziyadov: Baku will become a Dubai-like hub in Eurasia Azerbaijan intends to build a major trading hub close to its capital as a tax-free zone, with the expectation that other countries in the region will replicate the example and give a boost to the entire Eurasia region, Taleh Ziyadov told EURACTIV.com in an exclusive interview. We are eager to build on pragmatic and positive outcomes in our relations with the EU by reflecting on our ongoing negotiations on a new comprehensive agreement between Azerbaijan and the EU. The pace of negotiations on different chapters may vary but this does not question our objective to achieve a good agreement rather than a speedy one. I see more and more negative articles about Azerbaijan, the whole “laundromat series” for example. What is your comment? They are totally orchestrated, organized and synchronized. It started with campaigns about human rights, then went to corruption. And now we even see deliberate provocations to make references to Azerbaijan within coverage about some murders on the territories of different EU member states. Can you imagine, that the country being artificially cited, is the one that suffered from dozens of terrorist attacks in the beginning of the nineties, as a result of which approximately 2,000 people lost their lives?! Despite the occupation of an important part of country’s territory, Azerbaijan has never resorted to terrorist attacks against civilians in reaction to this occupation. Moreover, Azerbaijan is one of the most reliable partners in the international antiterrorist coalition, having the strong background of cooperation in this sphere, which is highly valued by the EU, NATO and other partners. This fake news is coming from the same media sources, the same newspapers, the same authors. I am convinced that all these attempts are doomed to failure. But what is their interest? My country is very serious at developing, it is actively engaged in major regional and European processes. We are going to Europe with a €47 billion project [the Southern Gas Corridor] – which is going to connect Europe with Asia and become, together with our neighbours, Georgia, Turkey, the Central Asian countries, the main transportation hub connecting Asia and Europe, the role of the country is really increasing… So someone wants to prevent bigger projects in Azerbaijan by de-stabilizing Azerbaijan? In any case, it aims at creating a negative image of the country and to separate it from the regional and European processes. Recently we saw the same attempts in the Council of Europe. We all witnessed that some circles in Europe rushed to congratulate Serge Sargsyan with the “successful” conduct of the parliamentary elections in Armenia. Ironically, right after the population forced him to resign as the prime minister chosen by this very parliament. But in the case of Azerbaijan, despite the completely biased statements, including the one by ODIHR on recent presidential elections, full public confidence toward country’s leadership continues to remain unchanged. We still regret the continuous double standards manifested by the European Parliament side as well, despite inter-parliamentary links between EU and Azerbaijan recently starting to progress. For instance, we noted two press releases at the official European Parliament website concerning reports on EU agreements with Azerbaijan and Armenia voted recently in the Foreign Affairs committee. Although the documents were similar in nature and content, the headlines of the press releases were enough to expose obvious bias concerning my country. That is about the question who is lobbying in the EU institutions. But the response from your side could go in two directions. One, which is visible, is creating big economic hubs, like the port of Baku. Secondly, your country can do much more to improve the human rights and media freedom situation so that such accusations will not be credible. The process of building transportation hubs has just started. We saw similar, even much harsher attempts to impede our energy projects, when we started them in the nineties. But despite all attempts we managed to make them happen. I am sure that the success story of Azerbaijan in the implementation of current energy and transportation projects will be repeated on a qualitatively new level. Concerning democracy and human rights. You know, today we are celebrating the 100th anniversary of the first parliamentary democratic republic of the Muslim East. [The Azerbaijan Democratic Republic proclaimed its independence in 1918 and became the first democratic state in the Muslim-oriented world.] Even one hundred years ago Azerbaijan was a democratic country, there was a government where different nations, ethnic groups were represented. There was a parliament with participation of Azerbaijanis, Russians, Germans, Poles, Ukrainians, Jews, Armenians, and Georgians. The parliament adopted women’s right to vote much earlier than most of European countries. And if you think that we do not have this tradition, well, we do. But the problem is that democracy is a complex issue. Today, the level of democracy in Azerbaijan is much higher than it was before. But keeping in mind specific elements of the regional situation, we should be consistent, but also careful in gradual liberalization of society without leaving any room for abusing those democratic liberties against the European values themselves. We have to be strong in order to duly protect these liberties. Statement by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Azerbaijan on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic https://t.co/HFHdNXlnjj @AzerbaijanMFA pic.twitter.com/I2lLT2VgUh — MFA Azerbaijan🇦🇿 (@AzerbaijanMFA) May 27, 2018 Do you make an allusion to foreign interference? Azerbaijan is not facing serious problems coming from inside of its society. But challenges from outside of the country are really serious. Especially now – in today’s turbulent world. The choice for Azerbaijan, which is located at the crossroads of the civilizations, is obvious: to become a new battlefield, new frontline or new conflict zone, as happened in too many countries of this part of the world, or to be engaged in creating a new map of connectivity of nations, cultures, economies, religions, countries and ,of course, peoples. We prefer the second option. In this unpredictable world, bridge constructors are more needed than their destroyers.",204

                Italy’s president set the country on a path to fresh elections on Monday (28 May), appointing a former International Monetary Fund official as interim prime minister with the task of planning for snap polls and passing the next budget.
The decision to appoint Carlo Cottarelli to form a stopgap administration sets the stage for elections that are likely to be fought over Italy’s role in the European Union and the eurozone, a prospect that is rattling global financial markets.



Technocrat PM to take over in Italy as President steps in to protect the euro
Italy’s president is expected to ask a former International Monetary Fund official today (28 May) to head a stopgap government amidst political and constitutional turmoil, with early elections looking inevitable.


The eurozone’s third-largest economy has been seeking a new government since inconclusive March elections, with anti-establishment forces abandoning efforts to form a coalition at the weekend after a standoff with the head of state.
President Sergio Mattarella vetoed the parties’ choice of a eurosceptic as economy minister, prompting the 5-Star Movement and far-right Lega Nord party to accuse him of betraying voters.
Both parties dropped drop their plan to take power, switched to campaign mode, and 5-Star called for street protests against the president’s rejection of their nominee, 81-year-old Paolo Savona, who has argued for Italy to quit the eurozone.
Cottarelli told reporters after his appointment that elections would be held in the autumn or early next year. He also tried to reassure investors on the Italian economy.
“Speaking as an economist, in the past few days tensions on the financial markets have increased,” said Cottarelli, who had served as a cost-cutting tsar to a previous government.
“Nonetheless the Italian economy is still growing and the public accounts remain under control.”

The prospect of fresh elections raised fears among investors that the vote could become a de facto referendum on Italy’s euro membership. The euro touched a fresh six-month low and yields on Italian debt climbed, increasing the extra borrowing costs or spread that Italy pays in comparison with Germany.
Already Italian politicians are pondering election tactics.


#5Stelle and #Lega are very likely going to win another 15% in new elections, almost all of the MP seats that are directly elected! #DiMaio #Salvini #Savona #Italy #Mattarella https://t.co/juCwWY30Iw

A 5-Star source said it was considering an election alliance with the League. In March, 5-Star ran its own campaign while the League campaigned as part of a right-wing coalition with the party of former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi.



Italy's centre-right leaders sign policy pact ahead of election
Former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi and his rightist allies agreed on Thursday (18 January) to a joint manifesto ahead of a 4 March national election, committing themselves to cutting taxes and rolling back pension reform.


“This is not a democracy, this doesn’t respect the popular vote,” League chief Matteo Salvini said after Cottarelli accepted his appointment by the president.
Salvini characterised the move as the death throes of a political establishment intent on keeping Italy “enslaved”, and afraid of the reaction of financial markets.
“The next elections will be a plebiscite — the population and real life against old political castes and the ‘lords of the spread’,” he said.
Failure likely
Salvini is tapping into a belief among many Italians that EU fiscal rules are rigged against Italy, even if many voters do not want to exit the euro.
“The euro has to stay, but we have to make our voice heard,” said Roberto D’Amelia, 68, a bar owner in central Rome.
At a Rome market, others criticised 5-Star and the League.
“I am a mother of a boy who has to travel the world and so I am convinced an anti-European minister is not the right thing for Italy,” said shopper Irene Teramo.
Cottarelli must try in the coming hours to form a government with majority support from parliament. He seems almost certain to fail, at which point the president would swear in him and his proposed cabinet, to serve until the next election.
He has been tasked with passing the 2019 budget by the end of this year, a challenge that may prove impossible without the confidence of parliament. In those circumstances, elections could be held as soon as September.
Fundamental choice
In a televised address on Sunday, Mattarella said he had rejected Savona, the coalition’s candidate for the economy portfolio, because he had threatened to pull Italy out of the eurozone.
“The uncertainty over our position has alarmed investors and savers both in Italy and abroad,” Mattarella said, adding: “Membership of the euro is a fundamental choice. If we want to discuss it, then we should do so in a serious fashion.”
The League and 5-Star, which had spent days drawing up a coalition pact aimed at ending a two-month stalemate, responded with fury to Mattarella, accusing him of abusing his office.
The 5-Star leader, Luigi Di Maio, called on parliament to impeach the mild-mannered Mattarella.
“Last night was the darkest Italy’s democracy has ever seen,” Di Maio said. “The truth is they don’t want us to take power.”
The 31-year-old said the anti-establishment group would organise rallies across Italy, including in Rome on 2 June.

“Make some noise, it is important that we do so all together,” Di Maio said in a live address on Facebook in which he reiterated the group had never planned for Italy to quit the euro.
League chief Salvini also threatened mass protests.
“If there’s not the OK of Berlin, Paris or Brussels, a government cannot be formed in Italy. It’s madness, and I ask the Italian people to stay close to us because I want to bring democracy back to this country,” he told reporters.
However, Salvini dismissed Di Maio’s impeachment call.
“We need to keep cool. Some things cannot be done in the throes of anger … I don’t want to talk about impeachment,” he told Radio Capital.
International reactions
The political chaos in Italy after the collapse of a bid by two populist parties to form a government sparked strong reactions across Europe on Monday.
French President Emmanuel Macron praised Italian counterpart Sergio Mattarella, saying he was fulfilling his role as guarantor of the country’s institutions with “courage and responsibility”.
“I reiterate my friendship and support for President Mattarella who has an essential task to undertake, (ensuring) the institutional and democratic stability of his country, which he is doing with a lot of courage and responsibility,” said Macron, after Matterella rejected a eurosceptic nominee for economy minister putting an end to the populists’ bid to form a government.
‘Wait and see’ 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s spokesman Steffen Seibert said Berlin’s “respect for Italian democracy and democratic institutions requires us to wait and see which government will lead the country and which ideas it will present to its EU partners”.
“The German government is always ready to work well and closely with an Italian government – that is our fundamental stance,” he added.
Euro support-
Germany’s EU commissioner Günther Oettinger called for eurozone partners to do what they could to convince Italian voters of the value of the single currency by exercising “positive influence on decision-making” in Italy, the DPA news agency said.
‘Time for bigger votes’ 
Leading Brexit campaigner and former leader of the UK Independence Party, Nigel Farage, said on Twitter:
“Italian voters will be furious that the establishment is blocking new ministers. Time for more elections and bigger votes.”
“If Italy gets another Mario Monti, pro-EU appointee as Prime Minister expect real anger.”
‘Confiscating democracy’ 
French far-right leader Marine Le Pen joined in the outrage over Mattarella’s veto of arch eurosceptic Paolo Savona as economy minister. She accused the president of a “coup d’état”, saying the “European Union and financial markets are again confiscating democracy”.


What’s happening in Italy is an absolute democratic outrage & shows EU will trample over all democracy to protect its tottering Empire & Euro. First they parachuted in Monti as PM 2011-13, a technocrat & ex EU Commissioner, now they parachute in Carlo Cottarelli, ex-IMF economist

                The Dutch government has launched a bid to overturn a landmark climate ruling, arguing that judges in The Hague “sidelined democracy” when they ordered a 25% cut in carbon emissions by 2020. EURACTIV’s partner The Guardian reports.
Government plans for a lesser 17% cut in CO2 pollution were deemed unlawful three years ago, in the first successful lawsuit against a government’s climate policy.
The case inspired a wave of climate lawsuits against governments in Belgium, Colombia, India, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Switzerland, the UK, Uganda and the US.
But Mark Rutte’s government on Monday (28 May) put the ball back in the plaintiffs’ court, arguing that judges in The Hague had overstepped their authority and were in danger of outflanking public opinion.



Reindeer herders and lavender farmers launch legal case against EU climate efforts
Lawyers acting for a group including a French lavender farmer and members of the indigenous Sami community in Sweden have launched legal action against the EU’s institutions for failing to adequately protect them against climate change. EURACTIV’s partner The Guardian reports.


Climate minister Eric Wiebes told Dutch media: “We also believe that renewable energy should be increased and CO2 emissions should be reduced, so this is really about something else: it’s about how the judge has intervened in something that’s [called] democracy, and actually democracy has been sidelined.”
After the original ruling, the Dutch government announced ambitious plans to phase out all coal plants and cut emissions by 49% by 2030, as measured against 1990 levels.
But the plans have not yet been implemented and Urgenda, the citizens’ alliance that brought the original case, said Dutch greenhouse gas emissions were currently only 13% below 1990 levels while CO2 output was largely unchanged.
Lawyers representing the group’s 886 Dutch plaintiffs told the court: “The Netherlands is 34th in the world when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions. But when it comes to per capita emissions the Netherlands ranks ninth – the highest of any EU country. A Dutch person emits twice as much as the global average and 1.5 times more than the average EU citizen.
“If we are not to reduce our emissions as quickly as possible, who is?”



Europe grapples with Dutch gas production ‘collapse’
For the first time, the Netherlands became a net importer of gas last year, reflecting the inexorable decline in production from Europe’s North Sea fields – an issue EU policymakers are only starting to come to terms with.


With Urgenda’s legal battle becoming a litmus test for the effectiveness of climate litigation, the judges’ verdict – expected on 9 October – will be closely watched.
Christiana Figueres, the former head of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, said: “Urgenda’s bold action against the government of the Netherlands created an important new incentive for all governments to act expeditiously.
“Governments must act boldly and urgently. The Urgenda climate case is evidence that this is not just what should be done, it’s what must be done.”
The World Meteorological Organization reported that last month was the third warmest April on record after 2016 and 2017, while Bering Sea ice cover fell to lowest level ever and a new CO2 ppm (parts per million) record was set.
In a sign of increased urgency in Brussels, the EU’s climate Commissioner, Miguel Arias Cañete, called this month for member states “to accelerate our efforts considerably and raise our ambition”.



Dutch offshore wind farms first in world to go subsidy-free
The Dutch government has begun to follow through on its renewable energy pledges by awarding Swedish firm Vattenfall two contracts for what will be the world’s first wind farms to be built entirely without public money.


A UN dialogue to begin the process of “ratcheting up” climate pledges made at the Paris climate conference is under way, and seven EU states have called for the bloc to raise its ambitions.
The Netherlands was one of them, and Wiebes reportedly proposed a 55% cut in Europe’s planet-warming emissions by 2030, describing the Dutch government as “one of the frontrunners on climate policy”.
Domestically though, frustration with the slow pace of climate mitigation helped the Dutch Green party to more than triple its count of MPs in elections last year.
Jesse Klaver, the Greens’ leader, told the Guardian: “The main reason for that is that citizens are fed up with a government that chooses the interests of fossil companies over the environment.
“The Urgenda case made it possible to call the government to account. The tragedy of Dutch climate policy is that our governments always had goals, but were never able to fulfil them. The verdict showed that when they fail to act on climate change a court can tell a government: you have a responsibility to protect your people and to keep your commitments.”
Climate actions have often been hostage to the changing composition of national governments, and the Dutch parliament is currently working on a climate change bill to ensure policy continuity.





Anne van Pinxteren, a government spokeswoman, said that while Rutte’s administration expected to cut emissions by between 19-27% by 2020, the court judges had “set a major legal precedent” in altering its plans.
“There is a chance that with current policy the emission reduction goal of the court will not be met,” she said. “If that is the case, the state will have to take additional measures which will need to have an effect in the very short term. These will most likely not be cost-effective and/or have big consequences on society.”
Environmentalists, though, counter that the cost of the toughest climate action now pales by comparison to the estimated $30tn of damages that not meeting it could bring.
Marjan Minnesma, Urgenda co-founder and director, told the Guardian: “Today in court we showed that it would cost around 0.5% of our GDP to meet the climate measures that have been proposed. If it is necessary and we are an extremely rich country and we can avoid extremely high risks, we think it should be done.”
            ","The Dutch government has launched a bid to overturn a landmark climate ruling, arguing that judges in The Hague “sidelined democracy” when they ordered a 25% cut in carbon emissions by 2020. EURACTIV’s partner The Guardian reports. Government plans for a lesser 17% cut in CO2 pollution were deemed unlawful three years ago, in the first successful lawsuit against a government’s climate policy. The case inspired a wave of climate lawsuits against governments in Belgium, Colombia, India, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Switzerland, the UK, Uganda and the US. But Mark Rutte’s government on Monday (28 May) put the ball back in the plaintiffs’ court, arguing that judges in The Hague had overstepped their authority and were in danger of outflanking public opinion. Reindeer herders and lavender farmers launch legal case against EU climate efforts Lawyers acting for a group including a French lavender farmer and members of the indigenous Sami community in Sweden have launched legal action against the EU’s institutions for failing to adequately protect them against climate change. EURACTIV’s partner The Guardian reports. Climate minister Eric Wiebes told Dutch media: “We also believe that renewable energy should be increased and CO2 emissions should be reduced, so this is really about something else: it’s about how the judge has intervened in something that’s [called] democracy, and actually democracy has been sidelined.” After the original ruling, the Dutch government announced ambitious plans to phase out all coal plants and cut emissions by 49% by 2030, as measured against 1990 levels. But the plans have not yet been implemented and Urgenda, the citizens’ alliance that brought the original case, said Dutch greenhouse gas emissions were currently only 13% below 1990 levels while CO2 output was largely unchanged. Lawyers representing the group’s 886 Dutch plaintiffs told the court: “The Netherlands is 34th in the world when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions. But when it comes to per capita emissions the Netherlands ranks ninth – the highest of any EU country. A Dutch person emits twice as much as the global average and 1.5 times more than the average EU citizen. “If we are not to reduce our emissions as quickly as possible, who is?” Europe grapples with Dutch gas production ‘collapse’ For the first time, the Netherlands became a net importer of gas last year, reflecting the inexorable decline in production from Europe’s North Sea fields – an issue EU policymakers are only starting to come to terms with. With Urgenda’s legal battle becoming a litmus test for the effectiveness of climate litigation, the judges’ verdict – expected on 9 October – will be closely watched. Christiana Figueres, the former head of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, said: “Urgenda’s bold action against the government of the Netherlands created an important new incentive for all governments to act expeditiously. “Governments must act boldly and urgently. The Urgenda climate case is evidence that this is not just what should be done, it’s what must be done.” The World Meteorological Organization reported that last month was the third warmest April on record after 2016 and 2017, while Bering Sea ice cover fell to lowest level ever and a new CO2 ppm (parts per million) record was set. In a sign of increased urgency in Brussels, the EU’s climate Commissioner, Miguel Arias Cañete, called this month for member states “to accelerate our efforts considerably and raise our ambition”. Dutch offshore wind farms first in world to go subsidy-free The Dutch government has begun to follow through on its renewable energy pledges by awarding Swedish firm Vattenfall two contracts for what will be the world’s first wind farms to be built entirely without public money. A UN dialogue to begin the process of “ratcheting up” climate pledges made at the Paris climate conference is under way, and seven EU states have called for the bloc to raise its ambitions. The Netherlands was one of them, and Wiebes reportedly proposed a 55% cut in Europe’s planet-warming emissions by 2030, describing the Dutch government as “one of the frontrunners on climate policy”. Domestically though, frustration with the slow pace of climate mitigation helped the Dutch Green party to more than triple its count of MPs in elections last year. Jesse Klaver, the Greens’ leader, told the Guardian: “The main reason for that is that citizens are fed up with a government that chooses the interests of fossil companies over the environment. “The Urgenda case made it possible to call the government to account. The tragedy of Dutch climate policy is that our governments always had goals, but were never able to fulfil them. The verdict showed that when they fail to act on climate change a court can tell a government: you have a responsibility to protect your people and to keep your commitments.” Climate actions have often been hostage to the changing composition of national governments, and the Dutch parliament is currently working on a climate change bill to ensure policy continuity. Anne van Pinxteren, a government spokeswoman, said that while Rutte’s administration expected to cut emissions by between 19-27% by 2020, the court judges had “set a major legal precedent” in altering its plans. “There is a chance that with current policy the emission reduction goal of the court will not be met,” she said. “If that is the case, the state will have to take additional measures which will need to have an effect in the very short term. These will most likely not be cost-effective and/or have big consequences on society.” Environmentalists, though, counter that the cost of the toughest climate action now pales by comparison to the estimated $30tn of damages that not meeting it could bring. Marjan Minnesma, Urgenda co-founder and director, told the Guardian: “Today in court we showed that it would cost around 0.5% of our GDP to meet the climate measures that have been proposed. If it is necessary and we are an extremely rich country and we can avoid extremely high risks, we think it should be done.”",206

                EU citizens generally think that judicial independence is going from strength-to-strength but in some countries, like newest member Croatia, the situation is still poor and even declining, according to the EU’s latest justice scoreboard.
The Commission’s annual scoreboard, published on Monday (28 May) for the sixth consecutive year, assesses the independence, quality and efficiency of justice systems in all European member states.
“Democracy, civic rights and due management of EU funds are under threat without the rule of law,” said Vĕra Jourová, EU Commissioner for Justice, Consumers and Gender Equality during the presentation of the findings.
The Czech official stressed that the publication comes at a time when maintaining rule of law is one of the most important EU priorities.
In comparison with previous editions, the 2018 scoreboard focuses on the independence of justice systems, the involvement of the executive and parliaments in the appointment and dismissal of judges and presidents of courts of justice, as well as prosecutor services.
Croats have lowest confidence in judiciary
The Eurobarometer data showed an overall improved or stable perception of judicial independence among EU citizens. Denmark, Finland and Austria scored highest in terms of confidence in judicial independence in 2018.
Croatia, which joined the bloc in 2013, ranked last, just ahead of Slovakia and Bulgaria, the scoreboard revealed.



Croatia's media freedom in jeopardy as delegation returns for second visit
The issue of media freedom in Croatia has earned the EU’s newest member the dubious honour of being visited twice in as many years by a team of press freedom organisation representatives. Upon return, they said the situation has improved but serious concerns remain.


Just over 20% of Croatians think the independence of courts and judges is very good or fairly good in 2018, which is 10% less than the year before.
Some 30% of Slovaks and Bulgarians thought the same, an increase compared to around 25% each in 2017.
Interference or pressure from government and politicians was the most common reason given for the perceived lack of impartiality.
Power of the purse 
Recent judiciary reforms in Poland and Hungary provoked only “slight changes” in the perception of the independence of the judiciary, according to the Commission.
But the EU is still on a quest to find an antidote against the deteriorating rule of law. “If a national justice system is broken, even in one country, (…) the trust will disappear,” Jourová warned.
During the presentation, she said the Commission had proposed a new rule of law mechanism of a strong conditionality in the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), under which compliance with the rule of law would be linked to the disbursement of European structural funds from the next EU budget.
The proposal goes a step further and refers to deficiencies in the rule of law: if they “impair or threaten to impair sound financial management or the protection of the financial interests of the Union, it must be possible to draw consequences for EU funding”.



Bulgaria dislikes Commission plan to link EU funding to rule of law
A major innovation in the next long-term EU budget proposed by the European Commission yesterday (2 May) is the conditionality between EU funding and the rule of law. But the country holding the EU Presidency voiced its own clear rejection.


Decisions by the European Court of Justice, reports from the Court of Auditors, as well as conclusions from relevant international organisations will be taken into account when assessing member state compliance.
Any countries under the spotlight will be given the opportunity to provide counter-evidence before any decision is taken.
Although this option is on the table, the proposal still awaits adoption by the Council with the European Parliament in consultation. But with European elections looming large, it is questionable whether the idea will survive the vote.

                Young EU citizens want to reclaim ownership of the European project and make it a force for good in the world. With culture and art, they could help cultivate an identity that would go deeper than legislation and regulation, writes Danuta Hübner.
Professor Danuta Hübner, PhD, is a Polish MEP (EPP) who chairs the Constitutional Affairs Committee. She was the European Commissioner for Regional Policy from 2004 to 2009.
Europe can and should bounce back by building trust with young people who hold the future of the EU and turning them into engaged citizens,
When I think of Europe, I think of the simple dreams it held for me as I was growing up on the other side of the Iron Curtain: human dignity, freedom, democracy. Back then, those dreams were forbidden and we looked West toward a free and unified Europe, sensing that it held the key to our future.
Back then, European integration was something fresh and young.
And indeed, when the European community was under construction in the 1950s, young people played a crucial, unifying role.
They protested along the Franco-German border to demand the frontier’s demise, and in front of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg to push for faster integration among European countries. They were fighting for a new order. They often spoke in terms of life or death for a united Europe.
But for the young people of today, the EU is just a natural environment in which they grew up. And you usually find flaws, errors, inconsequences in the natural environment you grew up in. Thus, when young people look at the EU, they do not see it as fresh but rather as stale and corrupted by political compromises.
They are unhappy with the current policies, like austerity, lack of political clout to change the world for the better, underdeveloped social dimension. Their opinion is often not just, because the EU, despite sometimes appearing old and slow, can still have the mobilising power for initiating and implementing big, good projects.
But I sympathise with the impatience of the young people. They are actually the ones that want more Europe, integrated at a greater speed, faster in meeting the real needs of European citizens.
I looked at some of the voices of the young people who spoke their opinions under the hashtag #New Narrative for Europe.
And there I saw what really held the interest of young people who will, I am certain, be future EU leaders:
Protection of personal freedoms and broadening public expression, increased mobility and making European travel a means for intercultural understanding, adopting new technologies in the cause of direct democracy, instituting a broad European education, better inclusion of young people in mainstream European parties, fighting extremism, social integration of immigrants and taking advantage of their potential for resolving conflicts in other parts of the world, making the EU a force for good in the world.
In other words, the new generation wants to reclaim ownership of the European project. And this is the old idea of citizenship. They often express their affinity for the EU differently than preceding generations: their main instrument is social media, flash mobs, informal networks, spontaneous events.
We were used to a different way of doing things in Europe: institutionalised practices, developing long-term relationships, effective lobbying for legislation. We were, and are, probably more patient, perhaps our expectations were too low. In this respect I think that actually, young people can push us to faster action, give us a sense of urgency.
Perhaps it will be the mission of the young people, of this generation, to stem the rise of populism, and to define Europe anew. We need an infusion of a new spirit.
Europe needs a stronger narrative — its people need more common stories, shared experiences, heroes to love and look up to. The Portuguese should be willing to share in Scandinavian jokes, and Latvians should learn to sing French chansons like it often happens in the Erasmus Program.
At a time when our Union faces internal challenges from populist movements and neo-totalitarian regimes, we mustn’t forget that culture and the arts can be forceful weapons and help cultivate an EU identity that reaches deeper than the laws and regulations.
On the political level, we will know that the beginnings of the Union as a real community takes hold, when Italians or the Dutch will care about the war in Ukraine, and when Poles and Hungarians will be willing to help Greeks and Italians in their refugee influx problems.
Europe is bouncing back in a big way. One of its big project announced in the new MFF perspective is more than doubling financing of programmes for young people (such as ERASMUS+ with €30 billion and the European Solidarity Corps with €1.3 billion, including €700 million to support Interrail passes for young people):
Europe wants to regain the trust and the confidence of its citizens, also the young ones, who will feel emotionally connected to Europe as the expression of their aspirations. . This is a great example of what the UE does to empower people. It also makes them engaged citizens.
And what the EU badly needs is to create such critical mass of engaged citizens to advance its agenda, concentrated on tangible results which should become a fundamental pillar of the new, institutionally-reconstructed Union.
The question is: how to create this critical mass? Where is it to be found?
My response would be that it is to be found in universities, in conference halls, in cafes of the cities of Europe, in all other places where the young people congregate.
These are the places where the wonderful motto of this year of European Youth Event (EYE2018) “The plan is to fan this spark into a flame” will become a reality.

                European Union Budget Commissioner Günther Oettinger apologised on Tuesday (29 May) after comments suggesting Italian voters would be punished by markets for voting for eurosceptic populists caused an uproar in the country.
“I fully respect the will of voters being left, right or centre and in every country. By referring to the actual market developments in Italy, I did not mean to be disrespectful and I apologise for this,” he said in a statement.

Markets will persuade Italians not to vote for the two populist parties that have tried and failed to form a government this month, the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement (M5S) and the anti-migrant Eurosceptic League, the EU’s budget Commissioner said earlier in an interview with Deutsche Welle.
Günther Oettinger made clear that he does not share the fear that the populist parties could become even stronger in possible new elections and that it could result in an exit of Italy from the eurozone or the EU itself.
On the contrary, the Commissioner raised the expectation that the markets and the Italian economic development would be a signal for the voters not to vote for populists from the left and right: “The negative development of the markets will lead Italians not to vote much longer for the populists.”
“We have confidence in the president of Italy, who points out to coalition partners of potential governments their rights and obligations, which result from the membership in the European Union and the euro area,” Oettinger said in the interview, expressing confidence in the new technocratic government.
The comments made in the interview created a buzz on the social media and provoked outrage from commentators,  leaving the Commission with some explaining to do.

This came after an earlier translation of Oettinger’s comments suggested an even stronger wording, saying markets will “teach the Italians to vote for the right thing.”
The journalist subsequently deleted this translation, explaining he had mistakenly “misquoted” Oettinger.

The first version of the comments caused an immediate reaction by Italy’s Lega Nord leader, Matteo Salvini, who demanded that Oettinger should resign, accusing him of intervening in the country’ election procedure. “Can you imagine such disdain for democracy? … He should resign this afternoon,” Salvini wrote on Facebook.

In the interview, Oettinger at the same time voiced hope that Italy would continue to be a net contributor, as many Italian companies would benefit from the single market, while the EU has in recent times increased resources such as earthquake relief or border management, adjusting “the budget to the needs, also in the case of Italy.”
Oettinger defends conditionality clause in MFF proposal
The Commissioner noted that the citizen’s support for the EU is significantly increasing: “This has to do with Erdogan, with Trump and with Brexit. People indeed notice that one is able to act in the European team.”
Especially when it comes to a “foreseeable trade dispute” with the US, the advantages of being part of the community would be obvious: “What would a country like Italy, like Germany be on its own? But as a European single market, as a Union, we have the opportunity to react to Trump.”
Asked if was upset that leaders like Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán scold the EU back home but at the same time hold out their hand for money in Brussels, he answered: “We must take note of this. But it is unacceptable. Governments in all member states tend to nationalise successes and Europeanise problems, and that is an unfair division of labour.”
In this context, the German Commissioner defended the new conditionality regulation in the forthcoming EU budget, which aims to make rule of law compliance a condition for future allocation of EU funds:
“It is about the interests of the European taxpayer, we are investing billions and we need to be sure that the member states and their administrations properly manage the funds and then properly settle them.”
“To prevent fraud and corruption in the European budget, it may be necessary to go to court, which is why we need the guarantee that judges are independent, that no one can bend the third power, that justice is dispensed and judges do not depend on their government.”
United front against Trump 
In the interview, Oettinger also made clear that despite the strained relations with the Trump administration, America remains Europe’s closest partner and friend.
However, he emphasised that if Trump should impose punitive tariffs on European goods, the Union ought to stay united: “If cars are affected, then everyone else must help – if Bordeaux is affected or if products from Italy are affected, then others must step in.”
“We must stand as a Union. If we leave somebody out in the rain, in the end all are disadvantaged,” the Commissioner concluded.

People indeed notice that one is able to act in the European team.” Especially when it comes to a “foreseeable trade dispute” with the US, the advantages of being part of the community would be obvious: “What would a country like Italy, like Germany be on its own? But as a European single market, as a Union, we have the opportunity to react to Trump.” Asked if was upset that leaders like Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán scold the EU back home but at the same time hold out their hand for money in Brussels, he answered: “We must take note of this. But it is unacceptable. Governments in all member states tend to nationalise successes and Europeanise problems, and that is an unfair division of labour.” In this context, the German Commissioner defended the new conditionality regulation in the forthcoming EU budget, which aims to make rule of law compliance a condition for future allocation of EU funds: “It is about the interests of the European taxpayer, we are investing billions and we need to be sure that the member states and their administrations properly manage the funds and then properly settle them.” “To prevent fraud and corruption in the European budget, it may be necessary to go to court, which is why we need the guarantee that judges are independent, that no one can bend the third power, that justice is dispensed and judges do not depend on their government.” United front against Trump In the interview, Oettinger also made clear that despite the strained relations with the Trump administration, America remains Europe’s closest partner and friend. However, he emphasised that if Trump should impose punitive tariffs on European goods, the Union ought to stay united: “If cars are affected, then everyone else must help – if Bordeaux is affected or if products from Italy are affected, then others must step in.” “We must stand as a Union. If we leave somebody out in the rain, in the end all are disadvantaged,” the Commissioner concluded.",209

                Europe should engage in the Middle East by providing technical aid and promoting investment and programmes that enhance tolerance and peaceful coexistence, said Falah Mustafa Bakir in an interview.
“If we don’t address the needs of people on the ground, they will become asylum seekers at the doors of Europe,” he warned.
Unlike the Kurdish minorities in Syria or Turkey, Kurds in Iraq enjoy a relative autonomy. Last year, the Iraqi Kurds organised an independence referendum which overwhelmingly approved their separation from Baghdad but no world power, including the EU, went along with such a scenario.
Falah Mustafa Bakir is one of the most active Iraqi Kurdish politicians who travelled the world to secure international support. He has been the foreign minister of the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG) in Iraq since 2006.
He spoke to EURACTIV Slovakia’s Lucia Yar.
The Iraqi elections held a few weeks ago had brought two peculiar moments. On the one hand, the low participation implied the frustration of the Iraqis, and on the other, the primacy was surprisingly secured by the anti-American, pro-Iranian cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. How do you assess the results of national elections?
All elections have elements of surprise, not only in Iraq. Yet we hope this is a new start for the country. If we can benefit from the mistakes of the past and be able to implement the constitutional articles, work on consensus, share the power and the wealth and be partners in decision-making, we have a chance. It is important for us to realise that this is the new opportunity, and maybe the last one.
Why the last one?
Because it is a tough time. Last year, we saw that the people of Kurdistan lost their hope for the future in the country. They wanted to exercise a very legitimate right – a right to self-determination – peacefully and democratically. We were expecting that the whole international community would respect the will of the people, yet we wanted to do it peacefully and with Baghdad. It did not happen, it seems that neither Baghdad nor the neighbourhood believe it.
Could the new government in Baghdad be of better help to Kurdistan?
The point is that we cannot have a premature judgement on the players who have won. A combination of like-mindedness between those who have the same aspiration of peace, stability, and security, working for the benefit of the Iraqi and Kurdish region would work. What can be done to send the right message to the Kurdish community, Turkmen, Christian, Yazidi, Sunni, Shia community that they are all partners?
For us in Kurdistan, there are issues that need to be addressed. Some of these are Iraq-wide issues – including the full implementation of constitution as a package; some are between Erbil and Baghdad, such as a proper mechanism of relationship or budget-sharing, the status of Peshmerga or the Kurdish language. As people of Kurdistan were denied having a state of their own, they should feel that they have a say in Iraqi politics. This way, we would be able to build trust and have a fresh start.
Although many world leaders, even the EU representatives, confirmed the support for the KRG, independence was out of the question for most. Iraqi Kurds and their leadership faced quite a disappointment.
Certainly, there was a huge disappointment of the people of Kurdistan, who expected that they – the international community – were our friends and partners, understanding the aspirations.
We said that we wanted our international partners to understand and help us, that we would not declare independence the day after, nor change the borders. Since we had declared this commitment and had been truly committed to it, we were expecting a sympathetic approach. What happened happened.
Do you regret not to change the strategy in advance, knowing that a result of the referendum will simply not be recognised in the form that had been executed?
The point is that when you talk about a democratic right, the right to self-determination, it is never wrong. But the problem is that the whole international order is in chaos. I believe there should be a revision of the UN literature and Charter. There is much talking about the rights of individuals, the rights of people, the right of self-determination, yet you handcuff them with sovereignty.
All those who tried to stop the referendum from happening could not stop the 93% of people who voted for it. That should be taken seriously. Nations do not want to live in subordination. We want to live as equals. A federal system is a system of governance that prepares the ground for sharing power and wealth. But when you deny this system, when you empty it from its content and you impose a strong central government, it does not work. It will not bring stability, nor prosperity.
Borders are sacred for some, but they are meaningless for others. Some people who are freedom fighters and sacrifice their lives for their nation are unfortunately are viewed by others as terrorists. We are labelled as terrorists. This is wrong. What gives the right to the world order to decide who should define the Kurds?
Calling Kurds terrorist is the recent rhetoric of Turkish president Erdoğan. When we talked last time, a few years ago, to my surprise you claimed that Iraqi Kurds have fine political and business relations with Turks. The situation has changed.
Our message to our neighbours is that we are a peaceful nation. We believe in cooperation and coexistence. The fact that Kurds are divided among four countries in the Middle East is not our fault. But we deal with today’s new reality and our approach is very clear.
Kurds in Syria need to have a better future – a future of their own that would be decided together with the Syrians. The same goes for the Kurds in Turkey, who should decide with the government in Turkey.
We believe in good relations and developing our bilateral ties, in political consultations, economic and cultural cooperation. And we are a safe neighbour to all our neighbours. We do not interfere in their internal affairs, and we do not pose a security threat to them, we are a neighbour that is committed to partnership. Therefore, we hope they understand the intentions of the Kurdish leadership in Iraq.
We cannot change geography and I believe we are bound together to accept each other.
How do you see the European Union´s role in the region, cooperating with the Kurds?
The EU can play an important role as it is closer to the Middle East, having more day-to-day contact with the region. Yet more commitment is needed to enhance on policy. Europe can do a lot in enhancing democracy in the Middle East – building institutions, helping the empowerment of women and the young, finding areas of common interest.
We have asked for a European commitment with Erbil and the KRG, yet everything must come through Baghdad. We are part of Iraq, but deal with us with a special program. Engage in programs that would enhance tolerance, peaceful coexistence, reject hatred and invest in culture and education. Engage with the KRG in building capacity, trying to provide a technical assistance, promoting investment and providing legal guarantees for the investors.
Secondly, when we talk about future of the Middle East, people do not feel safe or secure. Not having a future, they would decide to leave for Europe. If we do not address their needs on the ground, they will become asylum seekers at the doors of Europe. Help dealing with their problems. It would be cost-effective for Europe to do so.
The EU should not only focus on the humanitarian assistance for the displaced communities. It should go beyond that. We hope that the international community will be able to find a solution that would ensure that the region does not live in war, because the people have suffered a great deal and they need and deserve a better future.

                Individuals or groups who help migrants not entitled to protection to submit requests for asylum or who help illegal migrants gain status to stay in Hungary will be liable to jail under legislation submitted to parliament on Tuesday (29 May).
Prime Minister Viktor Orbán’s government has also proposed amending the constitution to state that an “alien population” cannot be settled in Hungary, rejecting European Union quotas to distribute migrants around the bloc.



Orbán sworn in as PM for third time, eyes 20 more years in power
Fresh from a landslide election win in April, Hungary’s combative premier Viktor Orbán was formally sworn in as prime minister Thursday (10 May), and hinted at designs on power until at least 2030.


In power since 2010, the right-wing nationalist Orbán has tightened state control over the media and campaigned on a platform of fierce hostility to immigration – policies that have put him in conflict with the European Union, which funds development policies to the tune of billions of euros a year.
The new bill also says that foreigners who sought to enter Hungary via a third country in which they were not directly exposed to persecution would not be entitled to asylum.

The draft legislation, which was immediately condemned by the UN refugee agency, is part of Orbán’s campaign against EU migration policies and against George Soros, a Hungarian-born US financier known for funding liberal causes.



Hungarian MEP: Orbán targets Soros because he is 'the perfect enemy'
The Hungarian government found the perfect enemy it was looking for in George Soros and is using him to promote its “hate propaganda” ahead of the upcoming national election, Hungarian MEP Péter Niedermüller told EURACTIV.com


The legislation comes only weeks after Orbán was re-elected by a landslide, and shows a hardening of his stance just as crucial talks begin about the EU’s next budget which proposes spending cuts in ex-communist countries of central Europe.
The text of the legislation, known as the “Stop Soros” bill and posted on parliament’s website, said: “Those who provide financial means … or conduct this organisational activity (for illegal immigration) on a regular basis will be punishable with up to one year in prison.”
“We need an action plan to defend Hungary and this is the STOP Soros package of bills,” the interior ministry said in a comment accompanying the legislation.
It said there were international and also Hungarian organisations helping the entry of illegal migrants to Hungary, adding: “Sanctioning these is justified.” It did not name any groups.
The government has said the bill intends to deter illegal immigration Orbán says is eroding European stability, and risks undermining Hungary’s Christian culture.



New Hungary protest as Orbán installs 'Christian democracy'
Thousands of Hungarians gathered Tuesday (8 May) to protest against strongman Viktor Orbán after he was nominated for re-election as prime minister for a third consecutive term during the inauguration of the new parliament.


While more than one million mainly Muslim migrants have entered the EU since 2015, few have sought to settle in Hungary. Official data show that in 2017 a total of 1,291 migrants obtained some form of international protection in Hungary, mostly Afghans, Syrians and Iraqis recognised as refugees.
The UN refugee agency UNHCR urged Hungary to scrap the draft law restricting non-governmental organisations, saying it would deprive refugees and asylum-seekers of vital services and encourage “rising xenophobic attitudes”.
“UNHCR is seriously concerned that these proposals, if passed, would deprive people who are forced to flee their homes of critical aid and services, and further inflame tense public discourse and rising xenophobic attitudes,” the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said in a statement in Geneva.
Fierce campaign
The new “Stop Soros” bill no longer contains a 25% tax that its previous version in February wanted to impose on foreign donations to non-governmental organisations that back migration.



Civil organisations in Hungary brace for government crackdown on NGOs
Non-governmental organisations in the crosshairs of Hungary’s EPP-affiliated government are seeking new funding sources and legal ways to counter a new law that would allow the interior minister to ban NGOs deemed to pose a “national security risk”.


But the Hungarian Helsinki Committee, which provides legal aid to asylum-seekers, said the bill was still “unacceptable in a democratic state” and against European democratic values.
“The government threatens those who stand up for human rights with the criminal code,” the committee said in a statement, stressing that its activities were all lawful.
Soros was publicly vilified during Orbán’s campaign for April elections. Orbán’s anti-immigration stance is particularly popular with voters in conservative rural Hungary.
Orbán has accused Soros and the NGOs funding him of plotting to undermine Hungary’s Christian character by flooding it with immigrants, an allegation Soros has repeatedly denied.



Nationalist MEP blames Soros for EU migration crisis
French MEP Jean-Luc Schaffhauser has blamed billionaire George Soros for having financed the “humanitarian infrastructures” that helped open Europe’s doors to uncontrolled flows of migrants, and for making money from the EU’s destabilisation.


The proposed constitutional amendment submitted on Tuesday would also provide a legal basis for the establishment of new administrative courts and a high court to deal with lawsuits concerning the public sector, flagged by the justice minister earlier this month.

                Ahead of the European elections, the conservative group of the European Parliament is getting closer to French sovereignist parties such as Debout la France to fill the gap left by British MEPs. EURACTIV.fr reports.
A year from the all-important European elections, new alliances are being formed among the Eurosceptics of the Parliament.
The co-chair of the European Conservatives and Reformists Group (ECR), Ryszard Legutko, took part in a joint work meeting with several French right-wing parties on 28 May.
Supported by “Les Amoureux de la France”, a political platform launched by the parties Debout la France and the French Christian Democratic Party, “European meeting for a plan B” aims to form an alternative common program ahead of the European elections.
During the first meeting, the right-wing parties and the ECR group once again criticised the functioning of the European Union. “The European Commission is usurping competencies that have not been given to it,” stated Legutko, while the chair of the Christian Democrat Party, Jean-Frédéric Poisson, spoke of “institutional brutality” in Brussels.
Though more meetings are organised, the two sides deny any official alliance for the 2019 European elections, for now.
According to Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, Debout la France and its partners of “Amoureux de la France” want to “first of all create a political programme”, before “trying to sway” electors. The French MP declined to comment on whether his party Debout la France would participate in the European elections.
 Nevertheless, during the conference Dupont-Aignan highlighted the rise of Eurosceptic parties in several European countries and stated that next year’s elections could be “an opportunity to have a European Parliament with a Eurosceptic majority”.



Seeking answers to euroscepticism
The prospect of Eurosceptic parties performing strongly in European and national elections has exorcised EU officials and pro-Europeans for the last 15 years. Britain’s impending departure from the bloc, coupled with the fact that the slow countdown to the next European elections in May 2019 is now underway, is focusing minds on how to avoid a repeat.


To date, Dupont-Aignan had shown more affinity with the British MEP Nigel Farage of the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy (EFDD) group in the European Parliament, also affiliated to the EFDD is the French party The Patriots, created by Marine Le Pen’s ex-right-hand man Florian Phillippot. 
However, creating an alliance with the European conservatives would allow Dupont-Aignan to create the first Eurosceptic force in the EP if his party were to participate in the elections.
For the ECR, such cooperation is also crucial as it is looking for new allies to compensate for the loss of its British MEPs after Brexit in March 2019. British MEPs account for 19 out of the groups 71 MEPS in total. Following the conference, Legutko confirmed he had spoken to parties in Austria, Italy, Slovakia, and Sweden to increase support for his group.
Europe based on cooperation
The programme which will come out of these meetings, and which should be finished in September, should “offer a political alternative”, according to Dupont-Aignan. The principle of “à la carte cooperation” is at the heart of the programme. 
According to the principle, each member state will be able to take part in a specific project of its choice. The areas concerned are yet to be defined but could touch on “economic, social and territorial cohesion, consumer protection, humanitarian aid” and “foreign policy”, according to a list found in the Alternative treaty for a Europe of nations.



Le Pen seeks to rally far-right allies for European elections
France’s Marine Le Pen led a rally of Europe’s far-right in the southern French city of Nice on Tuesday (1 May), to celebrate recent gains on the continent and devise a battle plan for next year’s European elections.


Drawn up by the French party Debout la France, the document will be used as a basis to reflect on the future common programme. Other than the cooperation principle, the text puts forward that decisions be taken unanimously, but with a right to veto for each member state. 
The European Parliament will also be transformed into a “European Assembly” made of “representatives of member states” elected by each national parliament.
            ","Ahead of the European elections, the conservative group of the European Parliament is getting closer to French sovereignist parties such as Debout la France to fill the gap left by British MEPs. EURACTIV.fr reports. A year from the all-important European elections, new alliances are being formed among the Eurosceptics of the Parliament. The co-chair of the European Conservatives and Reformists Group (ECR), Ryszard Legutko, took part in a joint work meeting with several French right-wing parties on 28 May. Supported by “Les Amoureux de la France”, a political platform launched by the parties Debout la France and the French Christian Democratic Party, “European meeting for a plan B” aims to form an alternative common program ahead of the European elections. During the first meeting, the right-wing parties and the ECR group once again criticised the functioning of the European Union. “The European Commission is usurping competencies that have not been given to it,” stated Legutko, while the chair of the Christian Democrat Party, Jean-Frédéric Poisson, spoke of “institutional brutality” in Brussels. Though more meetings are organised, the two sides deny any official alliance for the 2019 European elections, for now. According to Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, Debout la France and its partners of “Amoureux de la France” want to “first of all create a political programme”, before “trying to sway” electors. The French MP declined to comment on whether his party Debout la France would participate in the European elections. Nevertheless, during the conference Dupont-Aignan highlighted the rise of Eurosceptic parties in several European countries and stated that next year’s elections could be “an opportunity to have a European Parliament with a Eurosceptic majority”. Seeking answers to euroscepticism The prospect of Eurosceptic parties performing strongly in European and national elections has exorcised EU officials and pro-Europeans for the last 15 years. Britain’s impending departure from the bloc, coupled with the fact that the slow countdown to the next European elections in May 2019 is now underway, is focusing minds on how to avoid a repeat. To date, Dupont-Aignan had shown more affinity with the British MEP Nigel Farage of the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy (EFDD) group in the European Parliament, also affiliated to the EFDD is the French party The Patriots, created by Marine Le Pen’s ex-right-hand man Florian Phillippot. However, creating an alliance with the European conservatives would allow Dupont-Aignan to create the first Eurosceptic force in the EP if his party were to participate in the elections. For the ECR, such cooperation is also crucial as it is looking for new allies to compensate for the loss of its British MEPs after Brexit in March 2019. British MEPs account for 19 out of the groups 71 MEPS in total. Following the conference, Legutko confirmed he had spoken to parties in Austria, Italy, Slovakia, and Sweden to increase support for his group. Europe based on cooperation The programme which will come out of these meetings, and which should be finished in September, should “offer a political alternative”, according to Dupont-Aignan. The principle of “à la carte cooperation” is at the heart of the programme. According to the principle, each member state will be able to take part in a specific project of its choice. The areas concerned are yet to be defined but could touch on “economic, social and territorial cohesion, consumer protection, humanitarian aid” and “foreign policy”, according to a list found in the Alternative treaty for a Europe of nations.

                With populists trying to impose their agenda on the back of disinformation, the European Parliament is trying to reach out to the young, particularly those who don’t see the benefits of being part of the EU, write Ramón Luis Valcárcel and Sylvie Guillaume.
Ramón Luis Valcárcel and Sylvie Guillaume are Vice-President of the European Parliament in charge of Press and Citizen Relations.
Of all the generations of Europeans, the current young generation is the most pro-European. It is not a coincidence: almost 70% of them view being part of the Union as positive, according to the latest Eurobarometer survey. 
Most of them grew up, were educated, and made their life plans while making the most of the advantages that European citizenship conveyed, such as the right to study and work in more than twenty different countries, and are aware that their fundamental rights and freedoms are protected throughout the EU. 
However, youth support does not necessarily translate into active democratic participation. The interest shown by 15 to 24-year-olds in the European elections remains significantly lower than that of their elders, and few of them know that the next elections will take place in less than a year.
This is a concern for those of us who represent them in the democratically elected European Parliament. Especially as this is not just a random snapshot but provides further confirmation of a recurring phenomenon. 
We should not forget that during the last European elections in 2014 the greatest level of abstention was among young people, although they, too, displayed a more positive view of the Union.
At a time when populists backed up by powerful means of disinformation strive to breathe life into sentiments that undermine the values that define us as Europeans (respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, tolerance, equality, pluralism, non-discrimination, etc.) European democracy needs to reach places it normally finds difficult to access.
By this, we mean populations living in conurbations far from urban centres, underprivileged sections of the population and young people without a university education. While it is true that nine million people have benefitted from the Erasmus programme over the last three decades, it is equally true that a great many others have not had that opportunity.
And while Erasmus has become the best tool to foster a sense of belonging to the EU among its citizens, and has increased the chances of success for young people in the labour market, the EU institutions are also working to extend it to all young people, whether or not they are studying at university. 
For example, by extending it to vocational training and volunteering, it has also recently been allocated a greater budget. The aim is to offer everyone the same opportunities, regardless of their level of education and their aspirations.
As is already the case with the extension and the replacement of the Erasmus+ programme, communication by the institutions should also adapt to the social reality of the Union – mainly the perception that young people, who are digital natives, have of the Union and the ways in which they want to communicate with those institutions. 
And in this the Parliament has been working tirelessly. The Parliament, which remains at the forefront of technology, informs young people about how the institution works, the importance of the decisions it takes and how they affect their daily lives, through stories on Instagram, by releasing visually attractive content on Facebook and Twitter, posting educational videos on Youtube and by inviting speakers to talk about what Europe does for them, to become influencers.
Nonetheless, we do not overlook those citizens who continue to use traditional media, such as television, although the younger generation is less attached to these methods of communication it is not completely indifferent to them either. This is why adding a European dimension to entertainment as well as to news platforms is vital. The EU is of concern to all of us, talking about the EU in different ways and using messages adapted to different sections of the population is in the interest of everyone.
And that is where the regional and local aspect comes into play, essential for an EU founded on diversity. Rather than limiting debate to large cities, the EU institutions are now expanding their presence to smaller cities and rural areas. By taking the debate to the local level, the EU ensures that all citizens, regardless of where they live, can actively contribute to the ongoing debate on the future of Europe.
The EU has known for a long time now that the best way to get closer to citizens is to give them reasons to believe in it, to show them how its policies translate into tangible results which positively affect their daily lives. To do so, the institutions should communicate in an easily accessible manner. The EU should leave technical terms aside and adopt everyday language. And when it comes to young people it should adapt to technology and to new narratives. 
But above all, the EU needs to listen to its citizens more by putting them at the heart of the debate. It is therefore essential to communicate with young people, especially those who see no benefit in being part of the EU, and who don’t see the point in voting. Not only are they our future they are already part of our present. 
Voting in European elections is what enables Europe to take decisions, to grow and to improve itself. Our aim is to make young people aware of this and of the importance of voting. 
The European Youth Event (#EYE2018) is taking place at the European Parliament this week: more than 8000 young people from all over Europe will take part, which is a good starting point to proclaim out loud: 
European democracy needs you.

                Poland, and the ruling PiS party in particular, attaches great importance to history. It is therefore no wonder that it continues to change its history and the names of those who made it, with the help of the state-controlled media. EURACTIV’s media partner Gazeta Wyborcza reports.
The foreign ministries of Poland and the Netherlands have for eight years commemorated Professor Bronisław Geremek – a Polish politician, MEP and former foreign minister, who died in a car accident in 2008 – by organising memorial lectures and inviting distinguished columnists and experts to talk about Europe’s problems and its future.
These issues were the focus of Geremek’s life.
In 2017, the Geremek Lecture took place at the University of Utrecht. This year it was in Warsaw, at the National School of Public Administration, which prepares staff for the Polish civil service.
The speaker, Professor Ryszard Legutko, an MEP with the Law and Justice Party (PiS) which has ruled Poland for the past two years, made no reference to Geremek’s legacy.
The fact that it was a lecture in honour of the former Polish foreign minister was ignored. But this was no coincidence.
Under the PiS government, some names are being pushed out of the public space and the pages of history textbooks, and new ones are being substituted in their place.



EU Parliament backs Polish MEP in Communist 'witch-hunt'
A government probe into Poland’s troubled Communist past has spilled over to Brussels as Polish MEP and former foreign minister Bronislaw Geremek risked losing his mandate over his refusal to sign a certificate stating that he did not collaborate with secret police. 


Two years ago, when a NATO summit was held in Warsaw,  Geremek was nowhere to be found on the display boards of an exhibition prepared by the Polish defence ministry to present Poland’s road to NATO.
The famous photograph from 12 March 1999, in which Geremek, as the head of the Polish foreign ministry, signs the NATO accession documents in the Truman Library in Independence, Missouri, was nowhere to be found.
Why were Geremek and other well-deserving figures from Polish politics banned the exhibition? The Defence ministry, headed by Antoni Macierewicz at the time, claimed that it had decided to show the lesser-known people.
Ten years earlier Macierewicz had called Geremek a Russian agent. The state media, controlled by the PiS government and providing it with shameless publicity, broadcast material suggesting that the idea of Poland joining NATO was first promoted in the 1980s by a certain opposition activist, who later became an influential PiS politician.
This year, the defence ministry published a special video to mark the anniversary of NATO accession. It shows President Andrzej Duda and the current defence minister. Geremek went unmentioned.
Lech Wałęsa treated the same way
Lech Wałęsa, the legendary leader of Solidarity, is treated by the current regime in much the same way. The PiS head, Jarosław Kaczyński, worked closely but briefly with Wałęsa in the early 1990s, but the two later fell out completely. At present, Wałęsa is one of the most severe critics of PiS.
State media portray Wałęsa as an agent of the communist security services, a traitor and a loser. They also suggest – contrary to facts – that he was not the real founder of Solidarity, instead ascribing that feat to Lech Kaczyński, Jarosław’s twin-brother who later went on to become the president (until his death in the Smolensk air crash).
Wałęsa’s achievements for Poland go unmentioned in official broadcasts.



Thousands back democracy icon Walesa at Polish rally
Some 15,000 people gathered in the Polish city of Gdansk on Sunday (28 February), police said, in a show of support for Solidarity freedom hero Lech Wałęsa as he battles allegations he was a paid secret agent during the Communist period.


Name removals take place even at the lowest local level. The authorities of Krapkowice, near Opole in southern Poland, decided to name a roundabout after the late Professor Władysław Bartoszewski, a former prisoner of the Auschwitz concentration camp, a soldier of the underground and an anti-communist activist who became one of the most important Polish intellectuals after 1989.
But the regional directorate of roads and highways refused, claiming Bartoszewski was a controversial figure. He happened to be another critic of the Kaczyńskis’ party and was treated by the party as an enemy for many years. A public television presenter actually went as far as to suggest that Bartoszewski had been released from Auschwitz because he collaborated with the Germans.
PiS attaches great importance to history, and especially to propagating its own heroic version of it. So much so that a law was passed two months ago making it possible to get a three-year jail sentence for saying that Poland or Poles participated in the Holocaust or in other crimes that took place in the twentieth century.
If I were to write that Poland had committed a crime against peace by taking part in the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, I would have prosecutors at my back. At the same time, removing the names of people unpopular with the current authorities from public space and Polish history is legal, and at present even recommended.
Recognising his merits, the European Parliament dedicated a square near its headquarters in Strasbourg to Bronisław Geremek in 2009. For that reason, I think that – whatever PiS might do – it will not be able to falsify history completely.

                It was another exciting week in Strasbourg. Not only did MEPs from across the political spectrum race to show righteous anger at Donald Trump, the president of new protectionism, but they saw the fall (and rise) of two EU governments in the space of a few days.
While Parliament focused on the next long-term budget and its impact on regional policy (meaning money to less developed regions), Italy and Spain – two countries that are supposed to get more funding from Cohesion in the years to come – saw their political fortunes take a rollercoaster ride.
In an unexpected twist, Italy’s election winners, Five Star and Lega, went back to the drawing board after President Sergio Matarella dismissed their first attempt and reached a deal to form a  coalition government, led by political novice Giuseppe Conte.
MEPs interviewed by EURACTIV before the news was announced said Europe should not be afraid of a Lega-M5S coalition in office. 
“It is not a secret that we are very critical towards Europe,” M5S MEP Tiziana Beghin said. 
However, she insisted, “we have worked for four years here in Parliament and everybody knows how proactive and how constructive we can be, with the aim to improve Europe and to improve the response of this institutions to the needs of the citizens”.
One of the main concerns in Brussels is whether the new government might lead Italy out of the Eurozone. But Beghin insisted it was not their intention. 
However, Roberto Gualtieri, MEP from the outgoing Democratic Party, is indeed concerned about the impact the new government might have on Italy’s position in Europe. 
“We said since the beginning that an outcome of the elections making those parties stronger and weakening our party, our government, would make Italy weaker in all the negotiation tables,” and this, Gualtieri argues, is bad for Italy and for the EU. 
Nevertheless, the social-democrat MEP warned that the government might not last long. 
“If this government will pursue a programme of social injustice, like the flat tax, unsustainable finances and adventures like double currency, the people will send them home,” Gualtieri said.  “We will not leave the euro because Italians do not want that.” 
In Spain, a history of sorts was also made, after five deputies of Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) said they would support a motion of no confidence on conservative Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, weakened by corruption scandals in his own party.
Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez is thus set to become the first politician to oust a prime minister through a no-motion vote, which is scheduled for today (1 June).
With a concise “C’est fini” (it is over), socialist MEP Javi López reacted to PNV’s announcement. 
“Today we avoid the first obstacle on a path towards change in our country,” tweeted Podemos MEP Tania González. “I am excited with the possibility of a new horizon.”
In opposition to the left-wing parties’ excitement, Estebal González Pons, chair of the PP delegation in the European Parliament, attacked Socialist leader Pedro Sánchez for the support he got for the vote, including the Basque and Catalan deputies. 
“If Puigdemont is happy for Sánchez to become President, it is because it can’t be good for Spain,” González said.  Carles Puigdemont, the deposed Catalan leader now in exile in Germany, has been Rajoy’s arch-enemy and was indicted for his role in Catalonia’s independence referendum in October.

The Inside Track
By Alexandra Brzozowski
Eurosceptics take Rome. Anti-establishment and nationalist parties in Italy reached a new coalition deal reviving their plans to take power, narrowly avoiding snap elections and setting in motion an anti-austerity government in the eurozone’s third largest economy.
European Angst. South Tyrol looks anxiously towards Rome, speaking of the biggest crisis in Italy, worrying about the regions fate and warning of political experiments.
Digital midfielder. As the European Commission pushes forward with digitalisation policies, its DESI-index shows, that Germany is only in the mid-range of digitalization.
Fortifying Europe? Austria’s Upcoming EU Presidency revealed its iconoclastic plans to beef up the EU’s external borders protection. While it also wants to tie minimum income to German language skills.
Historic memory. While Poland. and the ruling PiS party in particular, attaches great importance to history, it continues purging history books to the beat of the PiS drum.
Overstepping authority? The Netherlands, a country as green as it gets, launched a bid to overturn a landmark climate ruling, arguing that judges in The Hague “sidelined democracy” when they ordered a 25% cut in carbon emissions by 2020.
How to referendum. Amid crumbling church influence, Ireland overturned its abortion ban in a landslide vote that Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said had finally lifted decades of stigma and shame.
Decarbonization laggard. Greece faces criticism for lacking a modern energy plan to ditch coal while a growing number of voices are now calling for an up-to-date energy transition roadmap.
NGO crackdown. When it comes to PM Victor Orbán, under new legislation, it could become a crime to distribute informational leaflets about migration and helpers be liable to jail.
Bad recognition. Georgia is about to cut diplomatic relations with Syria after Damascus recognised its breakaway regions as independent states.

With a concise “C’est fini” (it is over), socialist MEP Javi López reacted to PNV’s announcement. “Today we avoid the first obstacle on a path towards change in our country,” tweeted Podemos MEP Tania González. “I am excited with the possibility of a new horizon.” In opposition to the left-wing parties’ excitement, Estebal González Pons, chair of the PP delegation in the European Parliament, attacked Socialist leader Pedro Sánchez for the support he got for the vote, including the Basque and Catalan deputies. “If Puigdemont is happy for Sánchez to become President, it is because it can’t be good for Spain,” González said. Carles Puigdemont, the deposed Catalan leader now in exile in Germany, has been Rajoy’s arch-enemy and was indicted for his role in Catalonia’s independence referendum in October.

                Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orbán produced a video message on Saturday (2 June) supporting the efforts of Macedonia’s main opposition party to block a solution to the long-standing name dispute with Greece. He praised its refusal to bend “under pressure from foreign powers”.
Thousands of supporters rallied in favour of Macedonia’s nationalist opposition VMRO-DPMNE party (European People’s Party-EPP) in Skopje on Saturday and against the ongoing talks between their government and Athens to find a solution to the name dispute that blocks the country’s entry to NATO and hopes of joining the EU.
In his video message, Orbán, who is also an EPP member, hailed the party’s “wise and courageous leaders… who won’t bend under pressure from foreign powers”.
The negotiations between the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) and Greece are at an “advanced” stage while some technical details are still pending.
Greece wants an agreement on a compound name with a geographical or time qualifier that will apply to everyone, in order to support a solution and the integration of FYROM in NATO and the EU.
A sad exception
European Parliament Vice-President Dimitris Papadimoulis told EURACTIV that almost all EU political leaders, and the overwhelming majority of MEPs, support the Tsipras-Zaev efforts to finally resolve this 25-year dispute.
“A name for all uses, with real changes, in order to bring an end to irredentism and possible future disputes,” he said.
The Greek government has repeatedly asked FYROM to amend the articles of its constitution of irredentist nature to ensure it has no claims on Greek territory.
This is something that Elmar Brok (EPP), a close ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel, has also asked for.
In a recent interview with EURACTIV, Brok noted that it would be helpful for the Skopje government to understand that they have to tell Greece clearly that there is no irredentism, which is the “root cause of the problem”.
Papadimoulis, a close ally of Greek premier Alexis Tsipras, noted that Orban was a “sad exception”.
“Orban once again undermines the promotion of solutions that serve Greece, Skopje and the stabilisation of the Balkan region as well as the European perspective itself.”
“I expect Mr Joseph Daul to reiterate his position because the ‘orbanisation’ of the EPP not only harms democracy and Europe but also the EPP itself,” the leftist MEP warned.
EPP leader Joseph Daul told EURACTIV in January, “I hope that a mutually acceptable solution will be found and we welcome this window of opportunity that could lead to concrete results.”
The statement triggered strong reactions in Athens, with the government accusing the main opposition New Democracy party (EPP) of having different lines on the issue with its European family.



EPP chief: ‘Window of opportunity’ to resolve the Macedonian name dispute
The leader of the centre-right European People’s Party (EPP) Joseph Daul hailed the “window of opportunity” to resolve a long-standing name dispute between Greece and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), saying he hopes for “concrete” results.


No to erga omnes
The Skopje government might be okay with an “erga omnes” solution. However, this is not the case for the country’s President Gjorge Ivanov, who is an ally of the previous government, led by the nationalist centre-right VMRO-DPMNE, and is also seen as pro-Russian.
The actual name the two governments have agreed on has not been publicised yet; however, Greek newspaper Documento.gr reported on Sunday (3 June) that Tsipras and Zaev have agreed on “Severna Makedonija (Northern Macedonia)”, with an erga omnes usage.
EURACTIV reported in January that the VMRO-DPMNE of former Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski was trying to block talks. As prime minister, Gruevski had taken a hard line on the issue and negotiations were frozen for many years.
Hristijan Mickoski, the current VMRO-DPMNE leader, said on Saturday his party would oppose any constitutional change relating to the country’s name and called for a snap election.
In a statement, the Social Democratic Union of Macedonia (SDSM) accused Mickoski of following the path set by Gruevski.
“Mickoski’s vision is the division and the past. Mickoski must understand that Macedonia has only one vision, and this is a future of prosperity, economic growth and membership in the EU and NATO,” the SDSM party said.
At the recent EU-Western Balkans summit in Sofia, Greek PM Alexis Tsipras told EURACTIV the stance of opposition parties’ in both countries was “a critical issue”.
“Not so much for us, but for the domestic affairs of our neighbour, as our position requires a constitutional change [in Macedonia] which needs qualified majorities. So yes, it was one of the points of discussion between us,” Tsipras emphasised.



Skopje opposition's stance takes centre stage in Tsipras-Zaev talks
Athens and Skopje have moved closer to resolving their long-running name dispute but are not yet in a position to talk about an agreement, Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said on Thursday (17 May).


In Greece, the opposition New Democracy party has not made its position clear regarding the inclusion of “Macedonia” in the new name.
The right-wing party accuses the government of “secretive talks” and on Sunday opposed any agreement with FYROM that includes a “Macedonian ethnicity and language”.
The government says the opposition has two lines: one set by former New Democracy Prime Minister Costas Karamanlis, suggesting a geographical indication before the term Macedonia, and another one that rejects the term Macedonia altogether.
In the meantime, backers of a solution without including the term Macedonia are organising protests in Greece.
New Democracy Vice-President Adonis Georgiadis noted yesterday that the party does not participate in the protests but said its lawmakers and members could “participate at will”.
“New Democracy leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis should finally decide on his party’s line: does he agree with Joseph Daul and Costas Karamanlis or with the Orban-Georgiadis fraction?” Papadimoulis told EURACTIV.

                Azerbaijan’s strategic yet precarious geopolitical location and situation are such that the country deserves EU support, especially in light of growing tensions with Russia and Iran, writes Jan Zahradil MEP.
Jan Zahradil (ECR, Czech Republic), is Vice Chairman of the European Parliament’s Committee on International Trade (INTA) and President of the Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe (ACRE).
Past strains on EU-Azerbaijan relations have caused the small Eurasian nation to be neglected as a potential stable and reliable EU partner, but that time has come to an end. Its strategic yet precarious geopolitical location and situation are such that Azerbaijan deserves EU support, especially in light of growing tensions with Russia and Iran.
Recent events show a move towards fostering stronger relations with Azerbaijan. First there was the Azerbaijan-EU Cooperation Council meeting held in Baku in February. Then, there was a fruitful and positive EU-Azerbaijan Parliamentary Cooperation Committee meeting in early May. Now the Alliance of Conservatives and Reformists in Europe is organising a large-scale international conference in the country’s capital where it will focus on connectivity, infrastructure and energy issues, featuring several renowned speakers— the first of its kind to be organised by a pan-European political party.
Interestingly and perhaps symbolically, the event comes only weeks after the country celebrated the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan, which marked its birth as the first genuine parliamentary democracy of the Muslim world. Though the Republic only lasted two years before being destroyed by the Soviet Union, its imprint has always played an indispensable role in the country’s modern history.
However, Azerbaijan’s geopolitical situation is clearly very delicate. Its relationship with Russia has been strained by increasingly aggressive Russian behaviour aiming to grow the country’s influence over ex-territories. Any attempt by Azerbaijan to strengthen its ties with the EU is seen by Russia as undermining its national interest.
Russian strong-arm tactics are alive and well in the region. For instance, it is well-known that the resolution to the long-standing Nagorno-Karabakh conflict lies, to a large extent, in the hands of the Russians. Elsewhere in the Eastern neighbourhood, in Georgia and Ukraine, Russia has successfully taken a “divide and conquer” approach, creating lasting “frozen” conflicts. The country also uses widely-known tools to undermine Azerbaijan’s global reputation — an arsenal comprising media campaigns, fake news, hybrid info-wars, so-called NGOs which are, in fact, financed through secret channels, and so on. This is proof that the more independent Azerbaijan’s foreign policy becomes, the more irritated Russia gets. Actions such as Azerbaijan’s participation in the Chinese-led One Belt and Road initiative without Russian involvement, direct energy contracts with the EU and USA, and partial participation in some NATO operations are all unacceptable to Moscow. So, to push Azerbaijan out of the EU sphere of interests would be a fatal misreading of the small country’s geopolitical realities and would mark yet another victory for Russian pressure.
Relations with Iran are no easier. Currently, about 30 million ethnic Azeris are living in Iran, but are deprived of basic human rights including the right to use their native language. Azerbaijan’s policy towards Iran is strictly neutral, with them preferring not to intervene in Iranian internal affairs. For its part, Iran is afraid of the potential of its Azeri diaspora to call for a more secular and tolerant regime.
The Mullah’s dictatorship looks suspiciously upon Azerbaijan, which despite being a predominantly Muslim country, is strictly secular. Iran therefore believes it should gradually try to influence Azerbaijan to adopt a more traditional Islamic way of life, which would, of course, be contrary to the country’s modern history. With fundamentalist Iran representing the foremost ‘anti-Western’ power in the region, the West — including the EU— should focus on preserving Azerbaijan’s status as a positive example of a secular Muslim nation.
Azerbaijan, and most notably Baku, is also becoming an increasingly important hub for international transport and tourism, and of even greater significance is its growing role in the energy sector, where it is challenging both Russia and Iran. It stands at a fault line of a major competition for resources between East and West; it is the starting point for the critical East-West energy corridor and its oil and gas pipelines supply neighbouring countries and other further-reaching nations via BTC and BTE routes. Furthermore, the geopolitically crucial SGC (Southern Gas Corridor) project will open up another source of energy for Europe and will help diversify its energy supply, especially for Central and Eastern Europe.
In simple terms, the strategic geopolitical importance of securing Azerbaijan as a reliable and stable partner is one that the EU cannot ignore. It should be paid due attention and given due support. Short-sighted, one-sided, one-issue resolutions must be replaced with more long-term strategic partnerships based on proper analysis of the geopolitical context and priorities. I have no doubt that Azerbaijan is ready for this, and I believe and hope that Europe is ready as well.

                “Who do I call if I want to speak to Europe?” The quote is associated with Henry Kissinger but he never actually said it. He knew very well who to call if he wanted to. Similarly, European institutions have no problem with reaching out to European philanthropy, writes Felix Oldenburg.
Felix Oldenburg is secretary general of the Association of German Foundations and chair of DAFNE, a network of over 10,000 foundations, including the Association of German Foundations.
With a set of new EU policies, and with a next EU Parliament and Commission on the horizon, there is a new reason to open communication. After all, the EU and philanthropy work towards many similar goals. First, of course, both sides have to fully understand the potential of collaboration.
The institutions’ challenge is more fundamental: while working towards many of the same goals, the EU has neither been aware of many of the barriers facing European philanthropy nor the potential of working together. In short: there was little reason to call in the first place.
An event last week – innovatively framed as “PhilanthropyScrum” – has started to move in the right direction, Three key philanthropic infrastructure organisations, DAFNE, EFC and EVPA have joined forces to discuss a coherent policy agenda.
This agenda starts with a simple statement of fact: goods and services travel freely across Europe yet philanthropic support cannot. Whether this is by design or neglect, it must change.
Of more than €60 billion in philanthropic funds per year, only a fraction in the double-digit millions makes it across borders. This may not be the only indicator for the effectiveness of European philanthropy in solving increasingly international social, environmental and cultural challenges, but it highlights the many barriers to joining forces even within Europe.
Together, European donors and foundations ask for a single market for philanthropy and citizen action that recognises philanthropy, reduces barriers to cross-border philanthropy, enables and protects philanthropy, co-grants and co-invests for the public good.
Each of these four tasks have a number of concrete measures supporting them, ranging from a fairer VAT deal to stopping foreign funding restrictions, and from guaranteeing the free flow of capital to creating joint project pipelines for European public and philanthropic funders.
Representing one of the first major achievements of this joint advocacy effort, the European Commission has included a partnership with philanthropy in its proposal for the InvestEU fund, one of the signature projects in the multi-annual financial framework that will guide EU funding until 2027.
In a move to achieve more with less, the European Commission has included a co-granting mechanism as well as technical support and an innovative guarantee program de-risking foundations’ impact investments. Looking a few years into the future, it is easy to see how these measures alone could leverage substantial funding towards joint impact.
In addition, grantees supported by the program could potentially attract further cross-border funding without having to jump through the hoops of local charitable status discussions.
What we witnessed at the PhilanthropyScrum is the timely beginning of an ambitious roadmap that continues through the European Parliament elections in 2019 and the early days of the next European Commission in 2020.
There is no time to lose. More than at any time in the past decades, philanthropy faces a dual challenge: it needs to help solve problems that are more interconnected than ever before, and it needs to enter into a renewed effort to protect democracy and civil society at the same time.
We will need more than one telephone line. And we will need to speak with one voice.

                The Commission has unveiled its proposal for Horizon Europe 2020 and this comes at a critical time for the EU. But there needs to be close monitoring of the research agenda set, as current proposals could have dire consequences for democracy and sustainable development, writes Jill McArdle.
Jill McArdle is the European advocacy officer at Global Health Advocates.
The European Commission has released its proposal for the next EU research framework programme, Horizon Europe, set to begin in 2020.
The proposal comes at a critical moment for the EU. Democracy across the EU is in a state of transformation. Shaken by recent electoral shocks, leaders are paying closer attention to the voices of citizens, and experiments in democratic innovation are taking hold in the public sphere.
Meanwhile, the Paris Climate Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals have pushed global challenges to the top of the political agenda. This is thanks in no small part to civil society groups, who have campaigned tirelessly for decades on the need to radically transform our societies and set ourselves on a path to sustainable development within the planet’s boundaries.
Publicly funded research and innovation has a foundational role to play in addressing these challenges. It can offer an understanding of their nature, research alternatives to current models and support deliberation about possible conflicts and trade-offs. But to be effective, we must pay close attention to how the research agenda is set.
To ensure a needs-driven agenda, citizens must be at the centre of the process, both to reinvigorate democracy and harness the insights of those most affected by societal challenges. Civil society has an invaluable contribution to make here too, bringing its wealth of expertise and experience in areas like health and the environment, sustainable food and farming, climate and energy, and peace and democracy.
With this in mind, what has the EU proposed to do with the research budget? Zooming in first to the commitments on societal engagement, we see that engaging citizens and civil society in setting the research and innovation agenda is singled out as an objective of the programme. This is a positive move, though there are reasons to be cautious.
The concrete ways in which citizens will be engaged are left vague and undefined. And references to civil society are worryingly absent in the section supposedly dedicated to science and society.
Take a step back though, and the picture becomes even more concerning. The current proposal for Horizon Europe makes critical structural changes that could have catastrophic implications for democracy and sustainable development.
The current programme Horizon 2020 contains three pillars, focused on three distinct objectives: excellent science, industrial leadership and societal challenges (for example in health, food and climate). This coherent structure has been praised and reaffirmed at the political level and by numerous evaluations of the programme.
For Horizon Europe, the European Commission proposes to merge the second and third pillars of the previous programme under the heading “Global Challenges and Industrial Competitiveness”. This is a reckless move that puts research into real global challenges at risk.
What Horizon 2020 got right is that industry operates on a specific and distinct logic: profit and competitiveness. Societal challenges, on the other hand, focus on societal impact and therefore reflect the logic and interests of citizens and civil society.
We are told, of course, that these agendas naturally align. That these solutions to societal challenges are driven by the innovations of European industry. This may, in some cases, be true. But it is by no means a given that competitiveness will always be compatible with sustainable development.
And recognising that industry has a role to play is not the same as shoehorning the goal of competitiveness into a pillar meant to focus on the challenges faced by citizens and society. The key question here is, which goal will dominate? In the event of a conflict, what takes priority?
It is not hard to imagine how this will play out. Industry stakeholders are well-established within the programme. They know the programme well and how it works. They are well-equipped, well-resourced and well-organised. In comparison, citizens and civil society are not traditional actors in research and innovation.
They lack the insider knowledge and experience to effectively engage with the programme, as well as the resources needed to make themselves heard.
What chance has a needs-driven citizens’ agenda got against the might of industry? In this context, vague commitments on engaging society seem hollow and insufficient. At the level of societal engagement, a concrete roadmap to overcome barriers and boost engagement must be set out before the beginning of the next programme.
Structurally, a solution also presents itself. Horizon Europe will include a dedicated pillar for the European Innovation Council. Given that the EIC already integrates several elements of the Industrial Leadership pillar, and that their objectives are already closely aligned, this seems an appropriate place to house the remaining parts of Industrial Leadership.
This one move would preserve a dedicated pillar for independent research on urgent societal issues. We cannot afford to allow private interests to hijack a public research agenda intended to address citizens needs and deliver a just, equitable and truly sustainable future.
            ","The Commission has unveiled its proposal for Horizon Europe 2020 and this comes at a critical time for the EU. But there needs to be close monitoring of the research agenda set, as current proposals could have dire consequences for democracy and sustainable development, writes Jill McArdle. Jill McArdle is the European advocacy officer at Global Health Advocates. The European Commission has released its proposal for the next EU research framework programme, Horizon Europe, set to begin in 2020. The proposal comes at a critical moment for the EU. Democracy across the EU is in a state of transformation. Shaken by recent electoral shocks, leaders are paying closer attention to the voices of citizens, and experiments in democratic innovation are taking hold in the public sphere. Meanwhile, the Paris Climate Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals have pushed global challenges to the top of the political agenda. This is thanks in no small part to civil society groups, who have campaigned tirelessly for decades on the need to radically transform our societies and set ourselves on a path to sustainable development within the planet’s boundaries. Publicly funded research and innovation has a foundational role to play in addressing these challenges. It can offer an understanding of their nature, research alternatives to current models and support deliberation about possible conflicts and trade-offs.

                Macedonia’s deputy prime minister expects growing “external resistance” as negotiations on the name dispute with Greece get closer to a final deal which would unblock the country’s NATO and EU membership bid.
Bujar Osmani, Macedonia’s deputy prime minister for European affairs, told a panel on Thursday (7 June) that the next hours were crucial for the negotiations with Greece and reiterated that the country’s only path is towards NATO and the EU.
“My belief is that when we will be getting closer and closer to an agreement, the resistance will increase. In what form this resistance will transform these days I cannot predict,” he noted, speaking in English, warning that the collapse of the talks would have security consequences as well as economic and political ones.
He stressed that the name dispute also has a wider geopolitical angle as there are “external influences in the region”.
“It’s obvious that not all of the countries want Macedonia to become a member of NATO,” he said without elaborating.
On Tuesday, Russian Ambassador to the EU Vladimir Chizhov said that Moscow would be “happy to see the name issue resolved, but we will not applaud should Macedonia become part of NATO.”
However, when asked by EURACTIV.com if he suspects that Macedonia’s main opposition party VMRO-DPMNE is particularly under pressure from Russia to block a solution to the name dispute, Osmani replied: “I don’t think so”.
He said the VMRO-DPMNE had a new leadership and, while some of its members might attempt to derail the talks, he did not expect them to prevail.
EPP asks its parties to think “broad”
Another issue raised at the panel was the stance of the EPP, the EU’s biggest political family, on the name talks.
Last weekend, Hungary’s Prime Minister hailed the VMRO-DPMNE’s “wise and courageous leaders… who won’t bend under pressure from foreign powers”.
EURACTIV reported that Orbán “hails attempts to derail a solution to Macedonian name dispute.”
Macedonia’s MIA new agency quoted EPP sources as saying that it was EURACTIV’s “interpretation” of the comments made by Orban, who “was not clearly referring to the name talks”.
Asked by EURACTIV to comment on Orban’s statement and the Macedonia name dispute, an EPP spokesperson declined to comment.
“Mr Orban is sometimes absolutely unpredictable,” said Eduard Kukan, an EPP MEP on the European Parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee.



Orbán hails attempts to derail solution to Macedonian name dispute
Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orbán produced a video message on Saturday (2 June) supporting the efforts of Macedonia’s main opposition party to block a solution to the long-standing name dispute with Greece. He praised its refusal to bend “under pressure from foreign powers”.


He also noted that Orban had previously described the Nikola Gruevski-led VMRO government as “the most important stability factor in the Western Balkans”.
Referring to both Orban and the anti-migration Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS), the winner of last week’s parliamentary election there, he said they were not hiding the fact that they sometimes have different ideas from the EPP.
On the Macedonian name dispute, he noted that all EU countries agreed there was now a great chance of resolving the issue.
Asked by EURACTIV what he had told Greece’s main opposition New Democracy party, which has also expressed concerns about the ongoing talks, he replied that the EPP delivered the same message as it did to VMRO-DPMNE.
“They should look at these issues from a broader point of view, taking into account all the complexities, the situation and the consequences of a positive or negative result of this issue, both for Macedonia and Greece.”
He also said that New Democracy leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis had stated he would “at least not be completely negative.”
“Syriza has a safe majority in the parliament to pass an agreement”, Kukan said and added:
“Sometimes a leader has to see behind the corner […] has to be visionary”.
Referring to VMRO-DPMNE, he said, “we are speaking to them, we are telling them what is the interest of Macedonia and all political forces should contribute to a solution.”
Russia sees Western countries behind
In the meantime, Russia has reiterated its objection to Macedonia’s accession to NATO.
Speaking to journalists in Brussels on Tuesday (5 June), Ambassador Chizhov said the name dispute should have been settled long ago.
“We support efforts by both Athens and Skopje to resolve the issue. We understand that it is quite controversial domestically in both countries, in either country. And that is the result of the whole issue having been protracted for so many years.”
“Of course, we understand also that behind the ostensibly benign efforts of help coming from some Western countries, is a very simple wish: to see the Republic of Macedonia or FYROM, whichever you prefer, Russia has recognised it as the Republic of Macedonia, to see it become a member of NATO,” he noted.
He noted that Moscow views the enlargement of the EU differently from the enlargement of NATO.
“The enlargement of the EU is, I would say, a regional dimension of globalisation, whereas the enlargement of NATO is an attempt to address security risks and challenges of the 21st century with means and mechanisms of the mid-20 century.”

                This article is part of our special report Astana: 20 years of thriving evolution.Kazakhstan, the most impressive reformer in the Central Asian region, is set to benefit enormously from China’s Belt and Road initiative as an equal partner, Kate Mallinson of Chatham House said at an international conference marking the 20th anniversary of Astana, on 5 June.
Kate Mallinson is an associate fellow of the Chatham House Russia and Eurasia Programme.
Kazakhstan stands at the crossroads between East and West and between North and South, in an increasingly complex global environment. The country’s successful multi-vector foreign policy is enviable to many. Astana has been going through a sort of golden period, emerging as a neutral platform for the de-escalation and resolution of various conflicts and the country maintains positive relations with key powers including China, Russia, the EU and the US to name a few.
Astana will play a pivotal role in transforming this neutral platform into financial trade and transportation benefits for Kazakhstan as a whole. The country faces vast opportunities, from the various multilateral superplatforms – the EU, the Eurasian economic union and the Belt and Road Initiative. All three platform want to deepen their engagement with Kazakhstan. The Belt and Road initiative and the Eurasian economic union are examples of the emerging regional architecture of world politics today, and therefore it is very important they enforce positive development in Kazakhstan.
Although they geographically overlap, all three organisations differ substantially in history, motivation and design. The EU looks through the prism of good governance, democracy and strong commitment to human rights, while the Eurasian economic union focuses on modern economy, integration in a single market and free movement of capital, labour and goods and a unified legal basis. The Belt and Road initiative is driven by China to export domestic overcapacity and strengthen regional security. But there are some commonalities, including common security objectives, border strengthening, fighting transnational crime and targeting domestic and regional economic growth. This is where Kazakhstan fits in, because it shares these common objectives, and its involvement in all three platforms will assist its participation in free trade agreements in the WTO.
At the moment, unfortunately, the EU is staggering slightly under an increasing number of political risk issues, but bilateral connections between some of the EU countries and Kazakhstan, particularly the City of London and Astana, are currently very strong. Kazakhstan is a country with exceptional mineral pedigree and it’s a major investment destination for some of the largest European and American companies and financial institutions. These companies have pledged their interest in Kazakhstan for the next two to three decades.
China’s Belt and Road initiative has triggered a new European interest in Asia, and both Europe and China have a common interest in using this initiative to develop their domestic economies. The Eurasian economic union came into being at a difficult time because of Russian sanctions, while oil prices were plummeting. But Kazakhstan has masterfully navigated this challenges, as one of Russia’s most trusted and respected partners.
Astana can benefit from the difficulties currently playing out between the West and Russia by being a hub not only for trade but for diplomacy in the region. As times are getting complicated, how will Astana navigate Iran’s recently signed free trade agreement with the Eurasian economic union, in view of Kazakhstan’s  extremely positive relations with America? The future importance of Asia for Kazakhstan is perhaps the clearest economic and political power shifting East in the 21st century, and Kazakhstan really stands to gain from this.
During the 19th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party President Xi Jinping successfully consolidated his power and enshrined the Belt and Road initiative into the Party Constitution, meaning that the core principles of the BRI will be reflected in China’s long term foreign policy, and will likely remain even after the President steps down. Kazakhstan is the most pivotal country for China’s land route, with this new Silk Road project, it is the buckle in this belt. Both Kazakhstan and China will benefit from cooperation in the Belt and Road initiative to a huge degree.
Digitalisation is incredibly important, it’s the so-called fourth industrial revolution, changing the traditional industry’s business model, and expected to contribute as much as 14% of global GDP by 2030, as much as $15 trillion in today’s value. And Asia is the world’s digital champion. And Kazakhstan is embracing digitalization. Within the Digital Kazakhstan 2020 concept, Chinese telecommunication companies will contribute to smart technologies for the Kazakh transport network. Kazakhstan will benefit from digitalising its transport system, it is very important for this country which is the size of Western Europe, and the changes are going to be immense. But the main question today is how these multilateral connections will help Kazakhstan, the most impressive reformer in the Central Asian region. And this is particularly acute as Uzbekistan emerges to challenge Kazakhstan’s hegemony in the region. The recent recovery in oil prices has had a very positive effect on Kazakhs’s economy and for economic growth. But it could slow the transition to a new growth model.
Kazakhstan needs foreign direct investment focused on exports and an increasing productivity to diversify and transform the economy. The country needs to embrace Chinese investments but also challenge the underlying assumption that large scale investments in infrastructure such as those at the heart of the Belt and Road initiative automatically promote economic development. The future development of Astana as a financial trade and innovation hub, built on solid institutional reform, will strengthen Kazakhstan in negotiating with China as an equal partner.

                The political party that toppled its own government in Romania last year has made another head-scratching move: It is staging a massive protest in front of the building that houses the government it appointed only a few months ago.
Even Prime Minister Viorica Dăncilă will attend the rally on Saturday (9 June), called under the slogan ”We want prosperity, not security!”.
On the surface, the ruling Social Democratic Party (PSD)’s aim is to denounce the alleged abuses of the judiciary and the secret services, but even some of the PSD regional leaders say this is just a manifestation to support the party’s autocrat president Liviu Dragnea, besieged by legal problems.
Dragnea – who got a two-year suspended sentence for electoral fraud and expects on Friday (June 8) a verdict in an abuse of office trial – denies the protest is an exclusive PSD affair and has invited all people who had suffered from abuses of the “parallel state” to participate. But not many people are convinced.
“A party that dismisses two of its own governments and organises a protest meeting when it is in government – this hasn’t been seen anywhere in the world. It goes above Urmuz and Eugene Ionesco. Our country branding is the Absurd, with Liviu Dragnea as the maestro”, well-known novelist Mircea Cărtărescu wrote in a Facebook post.
PSD has been planning a huge meeting for months. It started as an idea to support the “traditional family”, then was changed to support Prime Minister Dăncilă, whose resignation was demanded multiple times by the country’s president, Klaus Iohannis, only to be changed again.



Romania's president denounces PM as 'unfit' for office
Romanian President Klaus Iohannis called on Prime Minister Viorica Dancila to resign on Friday (27 April) after she endorsed a secret deal to move the country’s embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and refused to attend a meeting to resolve other ongoing disputes.


The expectations of a massive turnout were also moderated, from more than a million people at first to tens of thousands.
Despite this decrease, there are many reports of people who say they are coerced to participate by either their bosses at work or public authorities controlled by PSD or their junior partners from ALDE.
On a newly-created website www.mitingcujapca.ro (which can be loosely translated as ’hustled meeting’), there were more than 330 reports on Friday morning of workers forced to attend the protest or coerced bus rentals. Even some professors have reportedly told students to join the protest in Bucharest.
Dragnea’s response was that people were encouraged to post that they are being pressured by PSD to attend and that the website was created by “the parallel state”. The www.mitingcujapca.ro website was created by civic organisation Geeks for Democracy.
However, Vladimir Petrut, a PSD member and the mayor of Cavnic, a former mining town in northwestern Romania, told Mediafax news agency that local and county councillors were told they will lose their mandate unless they attend.
Cavnic is some 550 km away from Bucharest and, in a country which has a notoriously poor road infrastructure, travelling by bus to the capital city will take more than 10 hours.  And many people in different parts of the country will have the same problem.
A few weeks ago, people in Iași – one of the largest cities in Romania, some 380 km northeast of Bucharest – started a motorcade to the capital city to protest the lack of a highway connecting the eastern area with the rest of the country.
But the Bucharest municipality, led by mayor Gabriela Firea, a PSD vice-president, did not authorise the protest at Victoriei Square, in front of the government headquarters.
The Saturday meeting has been authorised, however.
Moreover, the Parliament voted to exceptionally allow car parking in the yard of the Parliament Palace, a huge building in downtown Bucharest, on Saturday. “Why shouldn’t (the parking) be used? Maybe some PSD members of parliament want to invite supporters or colleagues to visit the Parliament Palace,” said Liviu Dragnea.
The PSD leader has also said that no one is forced to attend the meeting and that there might be undercover individuals among the crowd to tarnish the meeting’s image.
None of this should be a surprise for the leader who has attacked the “parallel state” in all those 18 months since his party has governed Romania. Dragnea himself cannot be prime minister because of the prison conviction, but he has a tight control over the government and last year he sacked two prime ministers who, he felt, were not responding to his commands.
            ","The political party that toppled its own government in Romania last year has made another head-scratching move: It is staging a massive protest in front of the building that houses the government it appointed only a few months ago. Even Prime Minister Viorica Dăncilă will attend the rally on Saturday (9 June), called under the slogan ”We want prosperity, not security!”. On the surface, the ruling Social Democratic Party (PSD)’s aim is to denounce the alleged abuses of the judiciary and the secret services, but even some of the PSD regional leaders say this is just a manifestation to support the party’s autocrat president Liviu Dragnea, besieged by legal problems. Dragnea – who got a two-year suspended sentence for electoral fraud and expects on Friday (June 8) a verdict in an abuse of office trial – denies the protest is an exclusive PSD affair and has invited all people who had suffered from abuses of the “parallel state” to participate. But not many people are convinced. “A party that dismisses two of its own governments and organises a protest meeting when it is in government – this hasn’t been seen anywhere in the world. It goes above Urmuz and Eugene Ionesco. Our country branding is the Absurd, with Liviu Dragnea as the maestro”, well-known novelist Mircea Cărtărescu wrote in a Facebook post. PSD has been planning a huge meeting for months. It started as an idea to support the “traditional family”, then was changed to support Prime Minister Dăncilă, whose resignation was demanded multiple times by the country’s president, Klaus Iohannis, only to be changed again. Romania's president denounces PM as 'unfit' for office Romanian President Klaus Iohannis called on Prime Minister Viorica Dancila to resign on Friday (27 April) after she endorsed a secret deal to move the country’s embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and refused to attend a meeting to resolve other ongoing disputes. The expectations of a massive turnout were also moderated, from more than a million people at first to tens of thousands. Despite this decrease, there are many reports of people who say they are coerced to participate by either their bosses at work or public authorities controlled by PSD or their junior partners from ALDE. On a newly-created website www.mitingcujapca.ro (which can be loosely translated as ’hustled meeting’), there were more than 330 reports on Friday morning of workers forced to attend the protest or coerced bus rentals. Even some professors have reportedly told students to join the protest in Bucharest. Dragnea’s response was that people were encouraged to post that they are being pressured by PSD to attend and that the website was created by “the parallel state”. The www.mitingcujapca.ro website was created by civic organisation Geeks for Democracy. However, Vladimir Petrut, a PSD member and the mayor of Cavnic, a former mining town in northwestern Romania, told Mediafax news agency that local and county councillors were told they will lose their mandate unless they attend. Cavnic is some 550 km away from Bucharest and, in a country which has a notoriously poor road infrastructure, travelling by bus to the capital city will take more than 10 hours. And many people in different parts of the country will have the same problem. A few weeks ago, people in Iași – one of the largest cities in Romania, some 380 km northeast of Bucharest – started a motorcade to the capital city to protest the lack of a highway connecting the eastern area with the rest of the country. But the Bucharest municipality, led by mayor Gabriela Firea, a PSD vice-president, did not authorise the protest at Victoriei Square, in front of the government headquarters. The Saturday meeting has been authorised, however. Moreover, the Parliament voted to exceptionally allow car parking in the yard of the Parliament Palace, a huge building in downtown Bucharest, on Saturday. “Why shouldn’t (the parking) be used? Maybe some PSD members of parliament want to invite supporters or colleagues to visit the Parliament Palace,” said Liviu Dragnea. The PSD leader has also said that no one is forced to attend the meeting and that there might be undercover individuals among the crowd to tarnish the meeting’s image. None of this should be a surprise for the leader who has attacked the “parallel state” in all those 18 months since his party has governed Romania. Dragnea himself cannot be prime minister because of the prison conviction, but he has a tight control over the government and last year he sacked two prime ministers who, he felt, were not responding to his commands.",222

                Viktor Orbán was once seen in the Brussels bubble as a bad boy, a political hooligan who is foolishly attempting to challenge an unbreakable political correctness.
Years have passed and he showed true staying power as the tide turned. Orbán’s ideas remained unbreakable while the political correctness is put into question. These days, more and more EU leaders imitate Orbán, who is not only becoming mainstream but appears to be the only visionary in Europe.
Orbán moves to jail NGOs for helping migrants? Italy is close to that, under the new government: the new interior minister Mateo Salvini calls NGOs “illegal smugglers”.
Orbán wanted camps for migrants outside the EU? In the EPP, this idea is becoming mainstream.
Orban wanted to deport all illegal migrants? This is in the programme of the new Italian government, and very likely in the electoral platforms of political forces across Europe.
Germany’s CSU leaders and Austria’s Prime Minister Sebastian Kurz are true fans of Orban, who is not shy of extending public support to his allies in Slovenia and Macedonia in the manner of a true political patron.
Orbán pushed back the migrants? The Commission has stopped saying that pushbacks are illegal and keeps its eyes wide shut when refugees are stopped and sent back by Libyan or Tunisian coastguards, sponsored by EU governments.
In April 2012, Orban told a public event in Brussels his country was a “laboratory for Europe”, suggesting that what today appears controversial in Hungary, would tomorrow become the norm for the rest of the EU.
This website asked Orban then whether he was suggesting that Europe should be “Orbanised”.  In his answer, he referred to his long history as a politician. (Today’s ‘Viktator’ was a youth anti-Communist leader and the founder of a centre-right political force.)
“I know what democracy means, I know what political competition is, because this is the key of my political success as well. Then you can be sure that when Hungary makes any laboratory progress for the European Union, it is on [the basis of] political competition and democracy,” he said, speaking in English in a very relaxed way.
With hindsight, this answer appears visionary.
After Angela Merkel, Orbán is the longest-serving EU prime minister, with the second largest number of EU summits attended (10 less than the German Chancellor).
But unlike Merkel, he is likely to stay at the helm much longer – he’s making plans for another 20 years. Orban knows how to be re-elected.  If at some point some believed that he was a burden to the EPP, now many see that he is in fact a big asset.

The Inside Track
By Freya Kirk
Friends rather than foes. Despite an anti-German campaign run by Poland’s ruling party, Polish people’s attitude towards Germans and the German view of Poles have not become more hostile.
Romanian theatre of absurd: The ruling political party, whose leaders has sacked two prime ministers in the past 18 months, is staging a massive protest in front of the government building in Bucharest on Saturday.
Name solution. Macedonia expects growing “external resistance” as negotiations on the name dispute with Greece get closer to a final deal, which would unblock the country’s NATO and EU membership bid. While Hungarian Prime Minister, Viktor Orban tried throw a spanner in the works.
Pacifying time extensions. According to a new proposal aimed at avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, the UK plans to remain in the EU’s customs union until December 2021.
The cow that went viral. The case of Penka, a cow that galloped across the border from Bulgaria to Serbia and may now have to be killed, has grabbed the attention of the media.
It’s a women’s world. Spain’s new Prime Minister, Pedro Sánchez, unveiled on Wednesday a new pro-EU government with the highest number of female ministers in the country’s history.
Coal exit. After a long wait, Germany’s government has appointed the long-awaited commission which is to define a roadmap for the country’s coal phase-out.
Too much Shakespeare. The growing popularity of English as a medium of instruction at Dutch universities is ringing alarm bells among local lecturers and students.
Peace and progress. Normalising relations between Kosovo and Serbia is “the most complicated process in the Balkans at the moment”, according to the EU’s envoy in Kosovo.
What a waste. Despite progress in recent years, local circular economy efforts in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia are still plagued by bad management, cheap landfilling and problematic reporting.

                EXCLUSIVE / An EU proposal to impose export controls on technology products that can be used as spyware is at risk of being delayed as a group of nine countries have pushed back against the overhaul.
EU officials are concerned that a bill to regulate the export of so-called dual use products could be toppled ahead of next year’s European Parliament election. Dual use products can be used for either civilian or military purposes and fall under special export controls.
Nine countries, led by Sweden, have united against the proposal’s clampdown on exports of technology products that could be used to harm human rights.
Sweden, the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom drafted a paper criticising the bill.
Diplomats from the nine countries warned that the proposal could lead to “portraying Europe as a technology-averse continent and an unlikely home for any global frontrunners on ICT or other technologies of the future generations” in a document that EURACTIV has obtained, which was circulated to all 28 member states on 15 May.
In 2016, the Commission proposed extending an existing EU export control law to cover technology products. The EU executive has billed the overhaul as its response to the Arab Spring, when European companies were caught selling surveillance software to governments that used it to spy on protesters.
New reports of such sales have continued to surface. In May, the NGO Access Now revealed that Turkey used software from the German firm FinFisher to monitor critics of the Turkish government.
But the future of the EU legislation is shaky.
Officials close to the negotiations said that Sweden was the driving force behind the document. A spokeswoman for the Swedish representation to the EU declined to comment on the initiative.
The document cautioned against moving ahead with new EU controls on exports that are not coordinated with major trading partners outside the bloc, including the United States.
“Controls on EU exports without parallel measures in the other major economies would serve only to push the development and production of relevant technologies outside of the EU,” the paper said.
The group of nine countries argued that a list in the Commission’s proposal that specifies products that would fall under tighter export controls “could seriously undermine the competitiveness of EU-based industry”.
Under the Commission proposal, mobile telecommunication interception equipment, intrusion software, monitoring centers, data retention systems and digital forensics would all need special approval from national export authorities.



Eleven member states back EU controls on selling spyware
EXCLUSIVE / Eleven EU countries have signalled their support for draft rules that would place export restrictions on companies selling surveillance technologies, a leaked working paper shows.


The new document deals a blow to the Commission’s bid to broker an agreement on the file.
Other countries have previously expressed support for the legislation, but sources with knowledge of the negotiations said that the group opposing the bill is more outspoken.
In February, a coalition of 11 countries—Croatia, the Czech Republic, France, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain—circulated a separate document backing the Commission’s bid to create “effective EU cyber-surveillance controls for the protection of human rights”.
Sources involved in the talks are worried that the opposing countries’ campaign against the legislation will mean that the file might not be approved before the May 2019 EU election. They are concerned that a new administration in the Commission and freshly elected MEPs could take a different approach to the bill.
The Parliament approved its version of the dual use legislation in January. But negotiations are stuck in limbo. The legislation can only go into effect after MEPs, national governments and the Commission strike a compromise on the bill.
MEPs are concerned that their work will go to waste if diplomats don’t speed up discussions.
Two of the lead legislators on the proposal sent a letter on 30 May to the Bulgarian and Austrian ambassadors in Brussels, urging them to wrap up talks between national diplomats and start negotiating with the Parliament by autumn.
Bulgaria holds the rotating presidency of the Council and chairs legal negotiations between national diplomats. Austria will take over that role in July.
“We should not risk to delay for years the modernisation of the current EU export control regime, while technology develops rapidly and threats to democracy and human rights are globally on the rise,” German Green MEP Klaus Buchner, who led the Parliament’s work on the file, and German Socialist Bernd Lange wrote in the letter.
Chances for a quick breakthrough appear small. Talks between national governments have moved slowly since the nine countries circulated their opinion paper.
A spokeswoman for the Bulgarian Council presidency said, “It has to be noted that rather complex elements are involved in the proposal that need careful examination. Based on the good work under the Estonian Presidency, the Bulgarian Presidency continued the work on this file. The respective working party has examined the text in a number of meetings. While some progress has been achieved it’s not yet possible to commit to any specific target date for the Council’s position or General Approach”.



MEPs approve export controls tailored to stop government surveillance
MEPs approved stricter rules on Wednesday (17 January) to control how European companies export technologies including software that could be used for surveillance, and any products that may violate human rights.

                The debate on the controversial draft law on “fake news” is set to continue in France but the law will not be adopted before July. Meanwhile, Brussels refuses to legislate this sensitive subject. EURACTIV.fr reports.
The two texts on manipulation of information during electoral periods were debated at the French National Assembly on 7 June. But, MPs did not complete their examination of the numerous amendments put forward in this controversial text.
The debate will probably continue during the extraordinary parliamentary session at the National Assembly in July. The main aim is for this text to be in force and tackle disinformation before the European elections in 2019.
“We need to reverse the abstention trend, fueled by the mass dissemination of dangerous news stories designed to undermine elections,” said the rapporteur of the text, Bruno Studer.
The proposals of the law  provide for the liability of digital platforms (Facebook, Google, Twitter), broadcast channels favoured for spreading “fake news”, strengthening the capacity to issue penalties of France’s broadcasting regulatory council and the possibility of going to court to suspend the transmission of “fake news” during the electoral and pre-electoral periods.
“Freedom of expression is a farce if information on the facts is not guaranteed and if the facts themselves are not the subject of the debate,” said the Minister of Culture and Communication, Francoise Nyssen, citing Hannah Arendt.
“We are not talking about ‘fake news’, as it is a term invented and popularised by the American President Donald Trump particularly to discredit information published by journalists,” stated Studer.
“The manipulation of information is a slow acting poison which destroys our credibility, and damages our democratic life,” added Nyssen. The Minister supported the proposals of the draft law put forward by MPs of the governing majority, stating that they had managed to strike a balance between combating propaganda and freedom of information.
“The text isn’t aimed at the production of false information but its dissemination, it is the sinews of war,” stated the minister. She also criticised the role of platforms that “do not play by the rules of democracy”. She believes that their business model plays a role in the dissemination of false information “they sell likes and followers to all, even to those that circulate fake news”.
Caution at European level
For now, the EU has taken a cautious stance by limiting itself to recommendations on the subject. The Commission has, for example, given online platforms until July to draw up a code of conduct to limit disinformation on social media.
Although the commission’s strategy is highly critical of online platforms, it has not put forward any binding legislative measures.



Commission threatens to legislate on ‘fake news’ ahead of 2019 EU election
The European Commission has threatened to introduce legislation on so-called fake news by the end of the year as part of its strategy to clamp down on online disinformation before the 2019 EU elections.


The EU’s proposal is aimed at creating a European framework to tackle disinformation so as to limit differing national legislations. “Our response cannot stop at national borders. Europe is at the frontline of a hybrid war conducted by certain third countries, for which disinformation has become a weapon of mass destabilisation,” said the rapporteur for the committee on European Affairs and LREM MP, Pieyre-Alexandre Anglade.
“The response can only come at the European level and cannot stop at our borders,” said the Republican MP, Constance Le Grip, for whom the texts put forward by the government are “at best ineffective and inapplicable”.
Highly criticised draft
In addition to the usefulness of a national law and the risks to freedom of information, certain provisions of the text are regarded as not very effective by civil society.
The possibility of seeking injunctions is particularly criticised. According to the EU Disinfo Lab, an NGO specialised in tackling disinformation, “the assumption that the judiciary will be able to discern true from false within less than 48 hours” is unrealistic.
Reporters Sans Frontières also criticised the scope for judicial action, as they believe that “defining false information as ‘any allegation devoid of verifiable evidence which might make it probable’ disregards the logic of journalistic work and does not leave the burden of proof of the erroneous nature of the story up to the court”.
For Constance Le Grip, there is “a risk of seeing so-called allegations of ‘fake news’ characterised by the court turning out to be true a few days later”.



Commission expert group pressures tech platforms to stop ‘fake news’ advertising
An expert group advising the European Commission on so-called fake news wants tech giants to be more transparent about their advertising revenue. Their new report pressures social media firms like Facebook and Twitter to deal with the spread of false information on their platforms.


The strengthening of France’s broadcasting regulatory council is also cause for concern. One of the main provisions of the text gives the council the authority to withdraw the broadcasting licence from a TV or radio station controlled by or being “under the influence of a foreign power”, if the station “jeopardises [France’s] fundamental interests, in particular by spreading false information”.

                Politicians in Poland’s ultra-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party are pushing to join the centre-right European People’s Party (EPP) after next year’s European elections. EURACTIV Poland’s media partner, Gazeta Wyborcza, reports.
If the move goes ahead, the EPP, which is currently dominated by Germany’s Christian Democratic Party (CDU), would also contain the Polish opposition party Civic Platform (PO) and Hungarian PM Viktor Orbán’s Fidesz.
“Recently, there has been no meeting of Polish government members with representatives of the European Christian Democrats at which the Polish side did not touch on the subject of joining the European People’s Party (EPP).”
“They assure that PiS will behave responsibly in the structures of this faction, that it will strengthen it and that Warsaw will help in pushing through next year’s budget,” one European official told Gazeta Wyborcza. 
This information has also been confirmed in the party and by other diplomatic sources.
EPP, the strongest faction in Parliament
With 219 deputies, the centre-right and pro-European EPP is currently the strongest political group in the European Parliament. It includes the two Polish opposition parties PO and PSL, but also Fidesz, the ruling party of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, which in Europe is increasingly criticised for breaking democracy in the country.
It is the Hungarian politicians of this party who intensely support the plans of their brothers-in-arms, the PiS, to join this group. “Together, we would have more influence. In general, membership in the EPP would give us the opportunity to act in a larger group,” said one PiS politician.



Hungarian vote badly divides EPP group
The centre-right European Peoples’ Party (EPP) was badly fractured yesterday (17 May) over a vote condemning the “serious deterioration” in the rule of law and fundamental rights in Hungary, with 107 of the group’s MEPs voting against the instructions of the EPP leadership, and only 92 following them.


Future of ECR in question
PiS has found itself in a corner because, as a result of Brexit, British deputies will disappear from the European Parliament, among them the Tories who, together with PiS, are the pillar of the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) faction.
Without the Tories, the ECR will have to attract populists or the extreme right to maintain its significance. By entering the EPP, PiS would be able to make an escape forward. At the same time, the party would get under the same protective umbrella Orbán has been using for years. Despite rising criticism, also from within the group, the EPP is still standing behind him.
The idea of PiS’ entry into the EPP is not new. Some PiS MEPs, including Ryszard Czarnecki, have already considered making the move after the last European elections, in 2014. At that time, there was no certainty that the party would come under the authority of Jarosław Kaczyński, the current party leader who gave PiS its ultraconservative edge.
The Civic Platform clearly stated its opposition: “If they want to join the EPP, then not as a party, but only individually and with their hands held high above their heads” explained a representative of Donald Tusk’s former government back then. 
In 2016, after the  PiS party came to power in Poland, the idea came back. According to the obtained information, it was among others Witold Waszczykowski, the head of Polish diplomacy, who explored the ground.



Behind the diplomatic scene: The case of Poland’s outgoing EU ambassador
Last week, Polish Ambassador to the EU Jarosław Starzyk resigned from his post in Brussels. In a portrait, Tomasz Bielecki, the Brussels correspondent of EURACTIV.com’s media partner Gazeta Wyborcza provides insight into the circumstances of Starzyk’s departure.


Veto of the Civic Platform
One thing has not changed. The Civic Platform is still against this idea. “Colleagues from PO have already been sending out clear signals a few weeks ago that if someone would think about adopting PiS, they will leave the EPP,” one of the Western MEPs said. Manfred Weber, the head of the political group, calmed them down saying that a possible PiS adoption is not on the agenda.
Kaczyński’s party, however, has an important argument in hand: in next year’s elections for the European Parliament, the EPP might lose deputies.
Also because French President Emmanuel Macron, according to unofficial information circulating in Brussels, seriously considers creating a separate faction after the European elections, which could lure deputies away from the EPP as well. In such a situation, PiS’ accession would strengthen the faction.
“We’re still probing for now. In the corridors, we sometimes hear comments from colleagues in the EPP that maybe we should join forces,” said one PiS politician.



Poland, Germany still friends despite PiS' anti-German campaign
Despite an anti-German campaign run by the Law and Justice party (PiS) government and the media that support it for almost two years, Polish people’s attitude towards Germans and the German view of Poles have not worsened in the slightest. EURACTIV’s media partner Gazeta Wyborcza reports.


Rule of law question as condition
A condition for the EPP to talk about it seriously is the end of the dispute between Poland and the European Commission on the rule of law that has been going on for two years.
In December last year, the Commission launched proceedings in this matter under Article 7 of the EU Treaty, which in theory may lead to the imposition of sanctions on Poland.
PiS politicians, on the other hand, began to push Brussels to give up from the proceedings, despite the fact that the government did not back down from the judicial reform criticised by the Commission.
Advisors to Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki argue that the Commission’s stubbornness only strengthens radicals in the United Right, such as Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro.

                As an EU judicial mission prepares to leave Kosovo, the assessments of its decade-long mandate are mixed — hailed by officials but criticised by the public.
The EU’s rule of law mission (EULEX) that will cease its judicial operations on 14 June was set up in December 2008, 10 months after Kosovo unilaterally declared independence from Serbia.



EU Kosovo mission finally on track as US joins
EULEX, the EU rule of law mission in Kosovo, finally seems to be on track following an historic US decision to join a European Security and Defence (ESDP) mission and concessions by both Serbia and Western allies.


Spending several hundred million euros over the decade, hundreds of judges and police officers served with EULEX, the political bloc’s largest civilian mission ever.


EULEX NEW MANDATE08 June 2018Following the Council’s decision, and the exchange of letters between President Hashim Thaci and EU High Representative Federica Mogherini, the EULEX Mission has received a new mandate until 14 June 2020.full press release: https://t.co/Ztc7Ms0K81

They were dealing with some of the most serious crimes committed during and after Kosovo’s 1998-1999 war between ethnic Albanian guerillas and Serb forces, the fight against corruption and organised crime as well as boosting citizen confidence in the judiciary.
“I have every reason to be dissatisfied with EULEX,” said 46-year-old Silvana Marinkovic, an ethnic Serb.
Her husband Goran was abducted in the aftermath of the war and his fate, like those of about 1,600 other people, still remains unknown.
“They did not even try to solve my problem,” she told AFP.
‘Visible legacy’ 
Alexandra Papadopoulou, a Greek diplomat tasked with winding up EULEX’s mandate, defended what she described as a “visible legacy in Kosovo with many achievements that are evident”.
European judges delivered over 648 verdicts, including for corruption, organised crime, money laundering, war crimes and human trafficking, she said.
The authorities share her assessment of EULEX’s achievements.
“It has been a worthy decade for Kosovo,” President Hashim Thaçi said. “Kosovo institutions have benefited greatly from cooperation with EULEX.”

Even so, Kosovo is ranked only 85th out of 180 countries on Transparency International’s corruption perception index, above Albania and below Serbia, albeit up from 110 in 2014.
In its latest report the European Commission said “corruption is widespread and remains an issue of concern” for the country of 1.8 million people.
The Zeri newspaper referred sarcastically to EULEX’s initial pledge to tackle “big fish”, saying the mission eventually remained a “mission of small fishes”.
Of three key ethnic Albanian rebel leaders who were put on trial, Sami Lushtaku and Fatmir Limaj were acquitted of war crimes charges, while Sylejman Selimi was sentenced to eight years in jail for torturing prisoners.
Among unsolved cases is the assassination of prominent journalist Xhemail Mustafa, who was shot dead at his home in 2000.
In his columns, the former advisor to late president Ibrahim Rugova had denounced violence committed by Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) guerrillas against opponents.
For his daughter Beriane Mustafa, EULEX is “completely a failed mission”.
“It is not clear to me how it is possible that an EU mission with all those resources has failed to solve any of these murders,” Mustafa, 36, told AFP, referring to a series of post-war political assassinations.
No wartime rape punished 
Kosovo’s war claimed 13,000 lives.
But EULEX eventually solved only 25 war crimes cases, according to the Humanitarian Law Centre rights watchdog.
“Despite systematic rape numbering thousands of victims committed by the Serbian security forces, there was no one single case solved and perpetrator punished,” it said in a statement to AFP.
“EULEX is a failure… a very good idea, but it was very badly implemented,” said Andrea Capussela.
Capussela, a former top official of the International Civilian Office (ICO), an international body charged with helping Kosovo function in its first independence years, wrote a book on the issue — “State-building in Kosovo: Democracy, Corruption and the EU in the Balkans.”
“All available indicators suggest that over the 10 years of EULEX mandate the rule of law has not strengthened in Kosovo but even seems to have weakened.”
He blamed “managerial incompetence and opportunism, and a political preference for not upsetting the status quo”.
Although they have not been proven, several corruption allegations targeting EULEX judges did not improve the mission’s image among local population.
“It would have been better if Europe had invested this enormous amount money in the creation of jobs,” said Jonuz Muftiu, a retired lawyer.
However, Papadopoulou argued that her mission was “never to solve with a magic wand all Kosovo problems on the rule of law in just a few years”.
Ariana Qosja, a researcher at local think-tank KIPRED, said she was pessimistic about the outcome of unfinished EULEX investigations now being transferred to the local judiciary.
In Kosovo, she said, the “judiciary continues to be under political directives”.

                Former Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt offered her views in Brussels about how the EU should improve globally and internally. The former leader of Danish Social Democrats said the EU should step out of Washington’s shadow but also review its policies on free movement of labour and migration.
For some observers, her appearance and comments on Monday (11 June) were a signal that she might join the race for the top EU job next year but Thorning-Schmidt, now the CEO of Save the Children International, declined a straight answer.
Thorning-Schmidt, who served as a prime minister in the worst period of the eurozone crisis, from 2011 to 2015, was a high-level guest at an event promoting the report ”Added value – what Europe can do to regain the initiative” by the BOLDT communications company.

She said she wanted to deliver some messages on how to re-energise Europe over the next years, after having been involved in European decision-making for more than two decades, starting as a trade unionist and an MEP (from 1999) as part of the Convention that led to the 2007 Lisbon Treaty.
First speculations about a top job for Thorning-Schmidt emerged when the post of Council President was up for grabs in 2014. In the distribution of top jobs a female social-democrat, with the experience of EU summits, is seen as a necessary contrast to the male EPP domination.
Asked if she was a candidate for Juncker’s job next year, she said:
“I don’t think you will get much of an answer from me. I will always do what I can for the European Union, as I say, for me, it’s not a technocratic, intellectual issue, it’s a deep feeling that we need to be together, we need to work together, and if we don’t, we will have the roughest and hardest form of globalisation, so I will always try to do my bit for Europe”.



Danish PM: EU top job speculation 'disturbs my work'
Ahead of a meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin, Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt denied rumours that she could be offered an EU position, saying the constant speculation was interfering with her work.


Thorning-Schmidt reminded the audience that she had attended more than 30 EU summits, at a time when in her words nobody from EU leaders wasn’t sure if Greece was going to default the next day and if the euro would survive.
Time for EU to “step in”
She quoted famous boxer Mike Tyson who once said “everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth”. She argued that Europe has received plenty of such punches in the last few years, but its lack of capacity to take decisions fast was compensated by those decisions being well rooted democratically and able to last a long time.
Europe’s weakness, she said, is that for too many years Europe needed “a nanny”, in the shape of the United States.
“For me it is completely obvious – it’s the EU’s time to step in”, she said, explaining that the EU should be much more engaged in issues such as the Middle East conflict, climate change, the Iran nuclear deal, including regulating the information society, platforms such as Facebook, but also artificial intelligence.
“No one will take that leadership if the EU doesn’t take that leadership”, she said.
The biggest threat for the EU, she said, was the governance of the eurozone, with a country like Italy representing a much bigger threat than the UK leaving the EU.  Although Denmark is not in the euro, she said the first thing on the EU’s “to do” list should be “let’s find a way to govern the euro”.
The next thing, she said, was “to watch our borders”. Europe must find a way to end the direct connection between immigrants or asylum-seekers arriving in Europe, and staying in Europe. In line with EU’s international commitments, the EU must make it clear that “if you don’t get your asylum rights in Europe, there has to be a return policy”.
Thorning-Schmidt said she realised what she was going to say is controversial, but said free movement of labour inside the EU also needed a revamp.
“We need to listen very carefully to what is being said by people when they are being asked”, she said, mentioning the name of former UK Prime Minister David Cameron who in her words asked the EU, before calling the Brexit referendum, for some changes on how the Union deals with free movement of labour.
“I still agree we should have free movement of labour, of course we should. But that doesn’t mean that member states cannot have some safeguards against things that seem obviously unreasonable,” she said.
Thorning-Schmidt argued that “some safeguarding of our welfare states” and “a little bit more of control of free movement of labour” was necessary.
“Unless we have that, and have that conversation, we will not gain the trust of people again”. “And when we do that, people will appreciate that we are taking action”, she said.
She said that without the EU, the European countries would have fallen prey to a rough model of globalisation where they would be no regulation, no control of the market economy.
“The EU is still the best protector of people, and I still think the European Union shows you can still have a market economy with a human face, it’s the only region in the world that actually tries to have a social model,” she said.
EURACTIV asked Thorning-Schmidt if she was throwing her hat in the race for European Commission president. Eric Maurice of EUobserver completed the question by asking if such a candidacy wasn’t handicapped by her controversial positions on migration and free movement of labour.
Thorning-Schmidt said that as a social democratic politician she saw migration going to the top of the political agenda, like her party had already done and still came in second with 25% of the vote in Denmark’s 2015 election, which in her words “wasn’t so bad if you look at social democracy across Europe”.
Without using offensive language against Muslims or foreigners, she said her force had convinced people that it was in control of the borders and of the migration pressure.
“And I would actually suggest that a lot of my European socialist colleagues would agree with this”, she said.

She argued that Europe has received plenty of such punches in the last few years, but its lack of capacity to take decisions fast was compensated by those decisions being well rooted democratically and able to last a long time. Europe’s weakness, she said, is that for too many years Europe needed “a nanny”, in the shape of the United States. “For me it is completely obvious – it’s the EU’s time to step in”, she said, explaining that the EU should be much more engaged in issues such as the Middle East conflict, climate change, the Iran nuclear deal, including regulating the information society, platforms such as Facebook, but also artificial intelligence. “No one will take that leadership if the EU doesn’t take that leadership”, she said. The biggest threat for the EU, she said, was the governance of the eurozone, with a country like Italy representing a much bigger threat than the UK leaving the EU. Although Denmark is not in the euro, she said the first thing on the EU’s “to do” list should be “let’s find a way to govern the euro”. The next thing, she said, was “to watch our borders”. Europe must find a way to end the direct connection between immigrants or asylum-seekers arriving in Europe, and staying in Europe. In line with EU’s international commitments, the EU must make it clear that “if you don’t get your asylum rights in Europe, there has to be a return policy”. Thorning-Schmidt said she realised what she was going to say is controversial, but said free movement of labour inside the EU also needed a revamp. “We need to listen very carefully to what is being said by people when they are being asked”, she said, mentioning the name of former UK Prime Minister David Cameron who in her words asked the EU, before calling the Brexit referendum, for some changes on how the Union deals with free movement of labour. “I still agree we should have free movement of labour, of course we should. But that doesn’t mean that member states cannot have some safeguards against things that seem obviously unreasonable,” she said. Thorning-Schmidt argued that “some safeguarding of our welfare states” and “a little bit more of control of free movement of labour” was necessary. “Unless we have that, and have that conversation, we will not gain the trust of people again”. “And when we do that, people will appreciate that we are taking action”, she said. She said that without the EU, the European countries would have fallen prey to a rough model of globalisation where they would be no regulation, no control of the market economy. “The EU is still the best protector of people, and I still think the European Union shows you can still have a market economy with a human face, it’s the only region in the world that actually tries to have a social model,” she said. EURACTIV asked Thorning-Schmidt if she was throwing her hat in the race for European Commission president. Eric Maurice of EUobserver completed the question by asking if such a candidacy wasn’t handicapped by her controversial positions on migration and free movement of labour. Thorning-Schmidt said that as a social democratic politician she saw migration going to the top of the political agenda, like her party had already done and still came in second with 25% of the vote in Denmark’s 2015 election, which in her words “wasn’t so bad if you look at social democracy across Europe”. Without using offensive language against Muslims or foreigners, she said her force had convinced people that it was in control of the borders and of the migration pressure. “And I would actually suggest that a lot of my European socialist colleagues would agree with this”, she said.",228

                The “horror” summit finally happened. But contrary to what European Commission top official Martin Selmayr expected two years ago, Donald Trump was enough to throw decades of Western Alliance down the drain.
In less than 48 hours of a “sobering” G7 meeting in Charlevoix (Canada), as Chancellor Angela Merkel said later, “stable genius” lashed out at the host Justin Trudeau (“dishonest and weak” because the Canadian leader defended his country); broke with US longstanding allies, backtracked on the “painstakingly negotiated” conclusions and left early, “excited” to meet the most brutal dictator on the planet.
Once again, the casus belli was trade imbalances and his unfounded perception that the US is being cheated by everybody. Trump rejected to stamp his signature on a communique that simply stated the obvious: “the crucial role of a rules-based international trading system”.
The sentence, as other references to rules-based international order, were also included in the G20 conclusions in Hamburg, signed by himself.
But in Hamburg, leaders already had an appetitive of what was coming as Trump rejected supporting the joint statement on the Paris commitments against climate change.
Trump’s ultimate goal seems to be trashing every alliance and international agreement he finds on his desk. And by doing it, he is cracking the Western community like no other leader did in peace times.
In his view, he has embarked on a fairness crusade. But his attacks against women, Muslims, Mexicans, media, his own administration and judges, his predecessors in the White House, fellow leaders, trading partners, allies, and a long list of victims prove how absent this value and other principles are in his moral compass.
As Twitter and TV programmes aired the “most dysfunctional G7 summit by a long margin” since the countries started meeting in 1975, as Eurasia’s Ian Bremmer put it, the scary question is how bad it could go before it gets any better.
The situation will improve only when he leaves, because we can hardly expect he would fall off his horse on his way to Damascus. If Democrats fail to impeach him, depending on the results of Robert Mueller’s investigation into the Russian affair, worse things could come in the next two years and a half.
Trump warned us that “change is coming”, which means he is ready to shoot again. Following his tariffs on steel and aluminium, the next target could be the car exports to the US market, as he hinted at plans to balance the trade deficit.
But his ‘America First’ would not stop with trade relations. The Paris accord or the Iran deal are warning signals of his shoot-on-sight policy.
We could feel relief that there has not been a major international crisis where his skills and temper were tested. Does anybody doubt that we would be living on a radioactive planet if he had been in the Oval Office during the Cuban missile crisis?
The expected strategy of isolating Trump may be the only option, although a risky one. The US’s weight is too big to be ignored and Trump could react by redoubling his attacks on the grown-ups like a grounded kid.
After trying all options, including bromancing (Macron), leaders have no options left apart from containing the damage after they realised that the US President is no longer an ally to the principles and values they represent.
“In the G7Charlevoix, President Trump saw that he had a united front in front of him,” said Macron. An “isolated” US is contrary to its history, he added. Only American voters or their congressmen could amend this regrettable chapter of the American saga.

The turbulent G7 summit (or G6 + 1, if you prefer) managed only to escalate into a new diplomatic and trade crisis, including between US and Canada. Twitter User @neontaster – a self-declared photoshopper of memes – captured the sentiment with his version of “The Last Globalist Supper“.
Meanwhile, Trump dashed across the globe to meet Kim Jong-un for super-important talks on North Korea. Fraser Cameron gives his take on the Summit of the Year.
Don’t aim too high on clean energy targets. German Energy Minister Peter Altmaier says voters across Europe have lost faith in politics partly because of “unachievable targets” on renewable energy, pouring cold water on the EU’s energy ambitions.
Uber’s Europe chief admits to our Jorge Valero that the company has made some mistakes and is now listening to its drivers and policymakers.
Conservative Social Democracy? Former Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt appeared in Brussels, saying the EU should step out of Washington’s shadow but also review its policies on free movement of labour and migration.
Brexit dream all but dead? Denis MacShane writes that Borison Johnson and David Davis are being sidelined by a Tory push for more pragmatism, which means “continuing the current customs unions and single market arrangements into the 2020s”.
More jobs needed. With less than a year before the next European election, EU stakeholders and MEPs attending a EURACTIV event expressed the need for the EU to create more and better jobs, going hand in hand with the need to have more funding.
Leaving the sinking ship. Faced with an increasingly likely implosion of the ECR group in the European Parliament after Brexit, Poland’s ruling PiS party is looking to join the EPP.
Look out for…
European Parliament in Strasbourg discusses the priorities for the 28-29 June EU Summit, as well as the future of Iran nuclear deal with Federica Mogherini.

                Following a string of far-right political successes barely a year before the next European elections, regional and local representatives have called on the EU to urgently act on migration, an issue that has quickly come back to the top of the political agenda.
“My plea is that the European Union adopts a single piece of legislation on migration,” said Rainer Haas, co-president of the Council of European Municipalities and Regions (CEMR) and president of the Ludwigsburg County (Germany).
He was speaking at the “Equality, Diversity and Inclusion” conference organised by the CEMR. Representatives from regions, cities, and towns gathered in Bilbao (Spain) for a three-day conference (11-13 June) to debate amongst other things social justice, tackling discrimination, gender, innovative democracy and open government.
But migration and its corollary, integration, were on everyone’s lips.
Incidentally, the conference started on the day that Spain announced it was giving MS Aquarius, a rescue ship packed with migrants, the green light to dock in Valencia. The news received loud applause from the delegates.



Verhofstadt threatens to take Council to court for 'failure to act' on asylum reform
The European Parliament debated the priorities for Europe on Tuesday, ahead of a crucial EU summit due on 28-29 June. Among those priorities, the reform of the Dublin regulation seems the most pressing and MEPs urged EU leaders to find an agreement on the asylum system.


Europe’s pitiful failure    
“Migration is the key issue on which the European Union has to deliver,” Karl-Heinz Lambertz, President of the European Committee of the Regions, told journalists on the sidelines of the event.
“Europe failed pitifully on that issue in the past”, he added.
Commenting on the upcoming European Parliament election and the rise of populism, he said that the main problem for the voters is not the MFF [the EU’s long-term budget], nor the future design of the structural funds or the subsidiarity issue.
“It is migration”, he insisted. “The atmosphere in Europe is quite Eurosceptic at the moment and if Europe does not come up with concrete results to show to the voters, it is likely to go wrong,” he added.
Lambertz was referring to the Aquarius blockade, which again highlighted the lack of solidarity European countries have displayed when it comes to receiving refugees since the start of the 2015 crisis, as well as Brussels’ powerlessness when it comes to playing referee.
Currently, the European legislation on migration, the so-called Dublin system, is based on the principle that asylum applications need to be filed in the first country of entry. But this simple geographical principle has created a profound imbalance between countries on the EU’s external borders, such as Italy or Greece.



MS Aquarius reveals a strained Dublin system
The refusal of Italy and Malta to take in the rescue ship Aquarius packed with migrants this week has shone a light on the flaws of European solidarity and underlined the urgent need to reform the Dublin asylum system. EURACTIV.fr reports.


2% refugees, full employment 
Ivana D’Alessandro, head of unit with Intercultural Cities within the Council of Europe, stressed that regions and cities were at the forefront of integrating refugees and asylum-seekers as they have to deal with housings, education, and training, employment as well as health issues.
“Migration has been seen as a short-term phenomenon but it is here to stay. We need long-term planning,” she observed.
“Cities are at the forefront when it comes to integration and they have gained expertise in that field. Member states have an interest in entering a dialogue with them,” she said.
Rainer Haas stressed the positive impact that integrating refugees and asylum-seekers has had on the local and regional economy.
“Currently, our unemployment rate in the region hovers at 3%, which means full employment. This is the lowest unemployment rate since many, many years,” he said.
And this while his city of Ludwigsburg has integrated 11,000 refugees; the equivalent of 2 % of the local population.
“At the height of the migration wave in 2015, there were days when 600-700 refugees arrived in one day. And the most urgent thing we had to do was to first find proper lodging for them. So we rented some public buildings and we even bought housings,” he recalled.
He explained that the strategy in the city of Ludwigsburg and in the Land of Baden-Württemberg is to integrate via the labour market. And in order to do this, every channel is used, from professional organisations to associations.
Mr Orban should visit us  
Bart Sommers, the mayor of Mechelen in Belgium, also underlined the positive impact of integrating migrants.
“We have 138 different nationalities and we have more Muslims in our city than Hungary and Slovakia together and it is working fine,” he said.
“Maybe Mr Orban can visit our town,” he added.
He recalled that about twenty years ago, the city of Mechelen had a bad reputation of being dirty, with few shops and social life.
“Now it is different – and positive,” Sommers said while making a distinction between asylum-seekers and persons of foreign origin born and raised in the city.
Regarding refugees, he explained that the city organises speed-dating between them and citizens of Mechelen. It lasts six months and after that, each of them gets a diploma at the town hall.
“This helps to build a relationship tremendously. And through this relationship, you get an easier access to housing and jobs,” he said.
As for persons of foreign descent born and raised in Belgium, he said we need to get rid of what he coined as “the group thinking obsession”.
“All of us have different identities. We are family members, musicians, bakers, sports addicts. This is where we have to focus on and this can be done through associations. It is not easy but it can be done,” he said.
“Migration is always defined as a loss,” he observed. “But things are different now, we must stop thinking in a monoculture approach. Diversity is the new reality.”



Italy’s rejection of Aquarius refugees lamentable and reprehensible, Nobel laureate says
Italy’s decision to turn a blind eye to the plight of migrants is all the less comprehensible as the country has a strong history of migration, said Rigoberta Menchú, the 1992 Nobel Peace Prize winner, while congratulating Spain for allowing the ship to dock in Valencia.
